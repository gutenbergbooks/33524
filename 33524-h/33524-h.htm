<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The first volume of this work, which comprised the Gifford Lectures
given by me at St. Andrews in the years 1911 and 1912, dealt with the
belief in immortality and the worship of the dead, as these are found
among the aborigines of Australia, the Torres Straits Islands, New
Guinea, and Melanesia. In the present volume I take up the subject at
the point at which I broke off, and describe the corresponding belief
and worship among the Polynesians, a people related to their neighbours
the Melanesians by language, if not by blood. The first chapter formed
the theme of two lectures delivered at the Royal Institution in 1916;
the other chapters have been written for lectures at Trinity College,
Cambridge, in 1921 and 1922. But in the book the lecture form has been
discarded, and the treatment of the subject is somewhat fuller than
comports with the limits imposed by oral delivery.</p>

<p>Should circumstances allow me to continue the work, I propose in the
next volume to treat of the belief in immortality and the worship of the
dead among the Micronesians and Indonesians.</p>

<h3>THE BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY AMONG THE MAORIS</h3>


<h4>&sect; 1. <i>The Polynesians</i></h4>


<p>The Polynesians are the tall brown race of men who inhabit
the widely scattered islands of the Pacific, from Hawaii on
the north to New Zealand on the south, and from Tonga
on the west to Easter Island on the east.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Down to the
eighteenth century they remained practically unknown to
Europe; the first navigator to bring back comparatively
full and accurate information concerning them was our great
English explorer, Captain James Cook. Thus at the date
of their discovery the natives were quite unaffected by
European influence: of our civilisation they knew nothing:
of Christianity, though it had existed in the world for nearly
eighteen hundred years, they had never heard: they were
totally ignorant of the metals, and had made so little
progress in the arts of life that in most of the islands
pottery was unknown,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and even so simple an invention
as that of bows and arrows for use in war had not been
thought of.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Hence their condition was of great interest to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
students of the early history of man, since it presented to
their observation the spectacle of a barbaric culture evolved
from an immemorial past in complete independence of those
material, intellectual, and moral forces which have moulded
the character of modern European nations. The lateness of
their discovery may also be reckoned a fortunate circumstance
for us as well as for them, since it fell at a time when scientific
curiosity was fully awakened among us, and when scientific
methods were sufficiently understood to allow us to study
with profit a state of society which differed so widely from
our own, and which in an earlier and less enlightened
age might have been contemplated only with aversion and
disgust.</p>

<p>The question of the origin of the Polynesian race is still
unsettled, but the balance both of evidence and of probability
seems to incline in favour of the view that the people are
descended from one of the yellow Mongoloid races of South-Eastern
Asia, who gradually spread eastward over the Indian
Archipelago and intermingling to some extent with the black
aboriginal inhabitants of the islands formed the lighter-tinted
brown race which we call the Polynesian.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A strong argument
in favour of this theory is drawn from the Polynesian
language, which belongs essentially to the same family of
speech as the Melanesian and Malay languages spoken by
the peoples who occupy the islands that intervene between
Polynesia and the south-eastern extremity of the Asiatic
continent.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The black Melanesian race occupies the south-eastern
portion of New Guinea and the chain of islands which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
stretches in a great curve round the north-eastern coasts of
New Guinea and Australia. The brown Malays, with the
kindred Indonesians and a small admixture of negritoes,
inhabit the islands westward from New Guinea to the Malay
Peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Of the two kindred languages, the Polynesian
and the Melanesian, the older in point of structure appears
unquestionably to be the Melanesian; for it is richer both in
sounds and in grammatical forms than the Polynesian, which
may accordingly be regarded as its later and simplified
descendant.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>But whereas the three peoples, the Polynesians, the
Melanesians, and the Malays speak languages belonging to
the same family, their physical types are so different that it
seems impossible to look on the brown straight-haired
Polynesians and Malays as pure descendants of the swarthy
frizzly-haired Melanesians. Accordingly in the present state
of our knowledge, or rather ignorance, the most reasonable
hypothesis would appear to be that the Melanesians, who
occupy a central position in the great ocean, between the
Polynesians on the east and the Malays on the west, represent
the original inhabitants of the islands, while the
Polynesians and Malays represent successive swarms of
emigrants, who hived off from the Asiatic continent, and
making their way eastward over the islands partially displaced
and partially blent with the aborigines, modifying
their own physical type in the process and exchanging their
original language for that of the islanders, which, through
their inability to assimilate it, they acquired only in corrupt
or degenerate forms.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Yet a serious difficulty meets us on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
this hypothesis. For both the Polynesians and the Malays,
as we know them, stand at a decidedly higher level of
culture, socially and intellectually, than the Melanesians,
and it is hard to understand why with this advantage they
should have fallen into a position of linguistic subordination
to them, for as a rule it is the higher race which imposes
its language on its inferiors, not the lower race which
succeeds in foisting its speech on its superiors.</p>

<p>But these are intricate questions which await future
investigation. I cannot enter into them now, but must
confine myself to my immediate subject, the beliefs of the
Polynesians concerning the human soul and the life after
death.</p>

<p>In spite of their diffusion over a multitude of islands
separated from each other by hundreds and even thousands
of miles of ocean, the Polynesians are on the whole a remarkably
homogeneous race in physical type, language, and
forms of society and religion. The differences of language
between them are inconsiderable, amounting to little more
than some well-marked dialectical variations: all dwell in
settled homes and subsist partly by fishing partly by the
fruits of the earth, tilling the soil and gathering coconuts
and bread-fruit from the trees:<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> all are bold and
expert mariners, making long voyages in large well-built
canoes: all possess a copious and comparatively well
developed mythology; and all at the time of their discovery
enjoyed, or perhaps we should rather say suffered
from, a singular institution, half social, half religious,
which may be summed up in the single Polynesian word
taboo. Hence it would no doubt be possible to give a
general account of the belief in human immortality which
would hold good in outline for all the different branches of
the Polynesian race; but such an account would necessarily
be somewhat meagre, inexact in detail, and liable to many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
exceptions. Accordingly I shall not attempt it, but shall
describe the creed of each group of islanders separately.
As the beliefs of the various islanders on this momentous
topic are characterised by a general similarity, the method
I have adopted will no doubt involve a certain sameness
and repetition, but for the serious student of comparative
religion I hope that these disadvantages may be more than
outweighed by the greater accuracy and fulness of detail
which this mode of treating the subject renders possible.</p>

<p>The principal groups of islands included in Polynesia
are New Zealand, the Friendly or Tonga Islands, the
Samoan or Navigators Islands, the Hervey or Cook Islands,
the Society Islands, including Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands,
and Hawaii or the Sandwich Islands.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> All of them, except
New Zealand, are within the tropics; and all of them,
except Hawaii, lie to the south of the equator. I shall
deal with them in the order I have mentioned, beginning
with New Zealand.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. <i>The Maoris of New Zealand</i></h4>

<p>The Maoris of New Zealand are not aborigines of the
islands which they inhabit: they possess long and apparently
in the main trustworthy traditions of their migration to
New Zealand many generations ago. The circumstances
which led to the migration, the names of the canoes in
which it was accomplished, the names and genealogies of
the chiefs who conducted it, are all recorded, having been
handed on by word of mouth from generation to generation,
till they were finally written down from the lips of the
natives by English enquirers.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The place from which the
Maoris came is unanimously designated as Hawaiki, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
island or group of islands lying far to the north or north-east
of New Zealand. Among English scholars there is
some difference of opinion whether Hawaiki is to be
identified with Hawaii, that is, the Sandwich Islands, or
with Savaii, one of the Samoan or Navigators Islands,
since Hawaii and Savaii are both dialectical variations of
the New Zealander's pronunciation of Hawaiki.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Though
Hawaii is more than twice as far as Savaii from New
Zealand, being separated from it by almost the whole
breadth of the tropics and a great stretch of ocean besides,
some good authorities have inclined to regard it as the
original home of the Maoris, but the balance of opinion
appears now to preponderate in favour of the view that
Savaii was the centre from which the Polynesians dispersed
all over the Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> However, the question is one that
hardly admits of a positive answer.</p>

<p>The Maoris are not a pure-blooded Polynesian race.
Among them even at the present day two distinct racial
types may be distinguished, one of them the comparatively
fair Polynesian type with straight nose and good features,
the other the swarthy, thick-lipped, flat-nosed, frizzly-haired
Melanesian type. They have a tradition that on their
arrival in New Zealand they found the country in the
possession of a dark-skinned folk of repulsive appearance,
tall, spare, and spindle-shanked, with flat faces, overhanging
brows, and noses of which little but the upturned nostrils
could in some cases be discerned. These savages wore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
little clothing and built no good houses, nothing but rude
shelters against the inclemency of the weather. They were
ignorant and treacherous, and the Maoris regarded them
with dislike and contempt; but their women looked with
favour on the handsome Maori men, and a mixture of the
two races was the result. This tradition both explains and
is confirmed by the two different racial types which still exist
side by side or blent together among the Maoris. It seems,
therefore, highly probable that before the advent of the
Maoris the North Island of New Zealand was occupied by a
people of inferior culture belonging to the Melanesian stock,
who may themselves have had a strain of Polynesian blood in
their veins and some Polynesian words in their language. This
at least is suggested by some features in the Maori traditions
about them. For these savages told the Maoris that they
were the descendants of the crews of three fishing canoes
which had been driven to sea from their own land in past
times, and that their original home was a much warmer
country than New Zealand. All these various indications
may perhaps be reconciled by supposing that the dark predecessors
of the Maoris in New Zealand were a Melanesian
people, who had accidentally drifted from Fiji, the inhabitants
of which have long been in contact with their
Polynesian neighbours on the east, the Tongans.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
received from the Maoris the name of Maruiwi,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and were
perhaps of the same stock as the Moriori of the Chatham
Islands; for two skulls of the Moriori type have been found
in an old deposit at Wanganui, near the south end of the
North Island of New Zealand.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>At the time of their discovery the Maoris had attained
to a fair level of barbaric culture. They lived in comfortable
houses ornamented with carved work and with scrolls
painted in red and white on the posts and beams. Their
villages were fortified with earthworks, palisades, and
trenches, and surrounded by large gardens planted with
sweet potatoes, taro, and melons.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "They excel in tillage,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
says Captain Cook, as might naturally be expected, where
the person that sows is to eat the produce, and where there
is so little besides that can be eaten: when we first came
to Tegadoo, a district between Poverty Bay and East Cape,
their crops were just covered, and not yet begun to sprout;
the mould was as smooth as in a garden, and every root
had its small hillock, ranged in a regular quincunx, by lines,
which with the pegs were still remaining in the field.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
They understood the arts of irrigating their gardens<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and of
manuring them so as to render the soil light and porous and
therefore better suited for the growth of the sweet potato,
their favourite food. For this purpose they used sand, and
in the Waikatoo district, where the root was formerly much
cultivated, deep excavations, like the gravel pits of England,
may still be seen, from which the natives extracted sand to
fertilise their gardens.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Moreover, they cultivated various
species of native flax and used the fibre for the manufacture
of garments, first scraping it and drying it in the sun, then
steeping it in water, and afterwards beating it with wooden
mallets. Thus prepared the flax was dyed black or reddish
brown and woven into cloth with broad borders of neat and
varied patterns. The stronger and coarser fibres were made
into string, lines, and cordage of all sorts.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The Maoris
also built large and magnificently adorned canoes,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> in which
they made long voyages; for example, they invaded and
conquered the Chatham Islands, which lie to the eastward
across the open sea about five hundred miles distant from
the nearest coast of New Zealand.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In hunting they had
little opportunity to shine, for the simple reason that in their
country there were no beasts to hunt except rats;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
birds they could not shoot, because they had no bows and
arrows to shoot them with,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> but they made some amends by
catching them in ingeniously constructed snares.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> They
caught fish both with nets, some of which were of enormous
size, and with hooks made of bone or shell.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> They
displayed great skill and infinite patience in fashioning,
sharpening, and polishing their stone implements and
weapons.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In council they were orators, and in the battlefield
warriors whose courage has merited the respect, and
whose military skill has won the admiration of the British
troops opposed to them.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In short, the Maoris were and
are one of the most highly gifted among the many uncivilised
peoples which the English race, in its expansion over the
world, has met and subdued. It is therefore of peculiar
interest to learn what conceptions they had formed of man's
spiritual nature and his relations to the higher powers.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. <i>The Beliefs of the Maoris concerning the Souls of the Living</i></h4>

<p>Like most other peoples, whether savage or civilised, the
Maoris explained the mystery of life in man by the presence
of an invisible spirit or soul, which animates his body during
life and quits it at death to survive the separation for a
longer or shorter time either in this world or another. But
like many others who have sought to fathom this profound
subject, the Maoris would seem to have experienced some
difficulty in ascertaining the precise nature of the human
soul. When the natural man, on the strength of his native
faculties, essays to explore these dark abysses and to put his
vague thoughts into words, he commonly compares his soul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
either to his breath or to his shadow and his reflection, and
not content with a simple comparison he is led, by a natural
confusion of thought, to identify more or less closely the
imperceptible entity which he calls his soul with one or both
of these perceptible objects. To this general rule the Maori
is apparently no exception. He has two words which he
specially uses to designate the human spirit or soul: one is
<i>wairua</i>, the other is <i>hau</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Of these words, <i>wairua</i>, the more
usual name, is said to mean also a shadow, an unsubstantial
image, a reflection, as of a person's face from a polished
surface;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and we may surmise that these were the original
and proper meanings of the term. Similarly <i>hau</i>, which is
described as "the vital essence or life principle" in man,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
appears primarily to mean "wind,"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> from which we may
infer that in its application to man it denotes properly the
breath. The idea of the soul as a breath appears in the
explanation which was given to Dumont d'Urville of the
Maori form of salutation by rubbing noses together. The
French traveller was told that the real intention of this salute
was to mingle the breath and thereby the souls of the persons
who gave each other this token of friendship. But as his
informant was not a Maori but a certain Mr. Kendall, the
truth of the explanation remains doubtful, though the Frenchman
believed that he obtained confirmation of it from his
own observation and the testimony of a native.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> On the
other hand the comparison of the soul to a shadow comes
out in the answer given by a Maori to an Englishman who
had asked him why his people did not prevent their souls
from passing away to the nether world. The Maori replied
by pointing to the Englishman's shadow on the wall and
asking him whether he could catch it.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Thus far the Maori conception of the soul does not perhaps
differ very materially from the popular notion of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
current among ourselves. But we come now to a marked
difference between the Maori idea of the soul and our own.
For whereas the European commonly believes his soul to be
fixed during life immovably in his body, and only to depart
from it once for all at death, the soul of the Maori is under
no such narrow restrictions, but is free to quit its bodily
mansion at pleasure and to return to it without prejudice to
the life and health of its owner. For example, the Maori
explains a dream by supposing that the soul of the sleeper
has left his body behind and rambled away to places more
or less distant, where it converses with the spirits of other
people, whether alive or dead. Hence no well-bred Maori
would waken a sleeper suddenly by shaking him or calling
out to him in a loud voice. If he must rouse him, he will
do it gradually, speaking to him at first in low tones and
then raising his voice by degrees, in order to give the truant
soul fair warning and allow it to return at leisure.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Believing
in the power of the soul to wander far away and converse
with other spiritual beings in sleep, the Maoris naturally paid
great attention to dreams, which they fancied were often sent
them by the gods to warn them of coming events. All
dreams were supposed to have their special significance, and
the Maoris had framed a fanciful system for interpreting
them. Sometimes, as with ourselves, the interpretation went
by contraries. For example, if a man dreamed that he saw
a sick relative at the point of death, it was a sign that the
patient would soon recover; but if, on the contrary, the
sufferer appeared in perfect health, it was an omen of his
approaching end. When a priest was in doubt as to the
intentions of the higher powers, he usually waited for his
god to reveal his will in a dream, and accepted the vagaries
of his slumbering fancy as an infallible intimation of the
divine pleasure. Spells were commonly recited in order to
annul the effect of ill-omened dreams.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>But the departure of the soul from the body in life was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
not always voluntary; it might take place under the compulsion
of a hostile sorcerer or magician. In a Maori legend
called <i>The curse of Manaia</i> we read that "the priests next
dug a long pit, termed the pit of wrath, into which by their
enchantments they might bring the spirits of their enemies,
and hang them and destroy them there; and when they had
dug the pit, muttering the necessary incantations, they took
large shells in their hands to scrape the spirits of their
enemies into the pit with, whilst they muttered enchantments;
and when they had done this, they scraped the earth into
the pit again to cover them up, and beat down the earth
with their hands, and crossed the pit with enchanted cloths,
and wove baskets of flax-leaves to hold the spirits of the
foes which they had thus destroyed, and each of these acts
they accompanied with the proper spells."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>This mode of undoing an enemy by extracting and
killing his soul was not with the Maoris a mere legendary
fiction; it was practised in real life by their wizards. For we
are told that when a priest desired to slay a person by witchcraft,
he would often dig a hole in the ground, and standing
over it with a cord in his hand would let one end of the cord
hang down into the hole. He then recited an incantation
which compelled the soul of the doomed man to swarm
down the cord into the pit, whereupon another potent spell
chanted by the magician speedily put an end to the poor
soul for good and all.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>It seems obvious that spells of this sort may be used
with great advantage in war, for if you can only contrive to
kill the souls of your foes, their mere bodies will probably
give you little or no trouble. Nor did this practical application
of the magic art escape the sagacity of the Maoris.
When they marched to attack an enemy's stronghold, it was
an ancient custom to halt and kindle a fire, over which the
priest recited certain spells to cause the souls of his
adversaries to be drawn into the fire and there to perish
miserably in the flames. In theory the idea was admirable,
but unfortunately it did not always work out in practice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
For magic is a game at which two can play, and it sometimes
happened that the spells of the besieged proved
more powerful than those of the besiegers and enabled the
garrison to defy all the attempts of the enemy to filch their
souls from their bodies.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But even when the assailants were
obliged to retire discomfited, they did not always lose
heart, the resources of the magic art were not yet exhausted.
On their return home the priest, nothing daunted by a
temporary discomfiture, might betake himself again to his
spells, and by crooning his incantations over a garment or a
weapon belonging to one of his party, might dash in pieces
the arms of the enemy and cause their souls to perish.
Thus by his ghostly skill would he snatch victory from
defeat, and humble the pride of the insolent foe in the very
moment of his imaginary triumph.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> One way in which he
effected his purpose was to take a bag or basket containing
some sacred food, hold it to the fire, and then opening the
bag point the mouth of it in the direction of the enemy.
The simple recitation of a spell then sufficed to draw the
souls of the adversaries into the bag, after which nothing was
easier for him than to destroy them utterly by means of the
appropriate incantation.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>But valuable as are these applications of magic to
practical life, the art, like every good thing, is liable to
abuse; and even where it is employed with the best intentions,
the forces which it controls are so powerful that in
spite of all precautions an accident will sometimes happen.
For example, in sickness the patient often had recourse to a
priest, who would lead him down to the nearest water,
whether a pool or a stream, and there perform the magical
rites necessary for the relief of his particular malady. While
the wizard was engaged in this beneficent task, all the
people in the village kept strictly indoors, lest their souls
should wander forth to the water-side and there colliding,
if I may be allowed the expression, with the mystic forces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of the priest's spells be damaged or even annihilated
by the collision.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In such a case the fatal consequences
were the result of a pure accident, but sometimes
they were intentional. For this fell purpose a malignant
wizard would dig a hole, invoke the spirit of the man
against whom he had a grudge, and when the spirit
appeared over the hole in the form of a light, he would
curse it, and the man whose soul was cursed would be sure
to die, sooner or later; nothing could save him. The
Uriwera, who dwelt dispersed among the forests and lonely
hills of a wild mountainous region in the North Island, were
reputed to be the greatest warlocks in all New Zealand.
When they descended from their mountains to the coast,
the lowlanders scarcely dared refuse them anything for fear
of incurring their displeasure. It is said that in their
magical rites they made a special use of the spittle of their
destined victims; hence all visitors to their country were
careful to conceal their spittle lest they should give these
wicked folk a handle against them.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Another mode in
which a Maori wizard could obtain power over a man's soul
was by working magic on the footprints of his intended
victim. The thing was done in this way. Suppose you
are walking and leave your footprints behind you on the
ground. I come behind you, take up the earth from your
footprints, and deposit it on the sacred <i>whata puaroa</i>, that is,
a post or pillar set up in the holy place of a village and
charged in a mysterious manner with the vitality both of
the people and of the land. Having laid the earth from
your footprints on the sacred post, I next perform a ceremony
of consecration over it, and then bury it with a seed of sweet
potato in the ground. After that you are doomed. You
may consider yourself for all practical purposes not only
dead but buried, like the earth from your footprints.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>From some of the foregoing facts it seems to follow
that the souls of the Maoris are not, so to say, constitutionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
immortal, but that they are of a brittle and
perishable nature, and that in particular they are liable to
be cut short in their career and totally exterminated by the
insidious arts of magicians. So frequently, indeed, did this
happen in former days that the Maoris of old apparently
recognised no other cause of death, but imagined that every
man and woman would naturally live for ever, if the thread
of his or her life were not prematurely snipped by the
abhorred shears of some witch or wizard. Hence after
every death it was customary to hold an inquest in order to
discover the wretch who had brought about the catastrophe
by his enchantments; a sage presided at the solemn
enquiry, and under his direction the culprit was detected,
hunted down, and killed.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The Maoris tell a story to explain how death first came
into the world, or at least how men were prevented from
enjoying the boon of immortality. The story runs as
follows.</p>

<p>The great mythical hero of Polynesia is Maui, a demigod
or man of marvellous powers, who lived in the early
ages of the world, and whose mighty deeds are the theme
of tales of wonder told far and wide among the islands of
the Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In his childhood his mother prophesied that
he should thereafter climb the threshold of his great
ancestress Hine-nui-te-po, and that death should have no
more dominion over men. A happy prediction, but alas!
never destined to be fulfilled, for even the would-be saviour
Maui himself did not escape the doom of mortality. The
way in which he became subject to death was this. His
father took him to the water to be baptized, for infant
baptism was a regular part of Maori ritual.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> But when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
baptism was over and the usual prayers had been offered
for making the lad sacred and clean from all impurity, his
father bethought him that through haste or forgetfulness he
had omitted some of the prayers and purifications of the
baptismal service. It was a fatal oversight, and the anxious
father was struck with consternation at the thought, for
too well he knew that the gods would punish the omission
by causing his son Maui to die.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Yet did his son make a
brave attempt to rescue all men from the doom of death
and to make them live for ever. One day, after he had
performed many feats and returned to his father's house, his
father, heavy at heart and overcome with a foreboding of
evil, said to him, "Oh, my son, I have heard from your
mother and others that you are very valiant, and that you
have succeeded in all feats that you have undertaken in
your own country, whether they were small or great; but
now that you have arrived in your father's country, you
will perhaps be overcome." Then Maui asked his father,
"What do you mean? what things are there that I can be
vanquished by?" And his father answered him, "By your
great ancestress, by Hine-nui-te-po, who, if you look, you
may see flashing, and, as it were, opening and shutting
there, where the horizon meets the sky." And Maui
answered, "Lay aside such idle thoughts, and let us both
fearlessly seek whether men are to die or live for ever."
And his father said, "My child, there has been an ill omen
for us; when I was baptizing you, I omitted a portion of
the fitting prayers, and that I know will be the cause of
your perishing." Then Maui asked his father, "What is
my ancestress Hine-nui-te-po like?" and he answered,
"What you see yonder shining so brightly red are her eyes,
and her teeth are as sharp and hard as pieces of volcanic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
glass; her body is like that of a man, and as for the pupils
of her eyes, they are jasper; and her hair is like the tangles
of long sea-weed, and her mouth is like that of a barracouta."</p>

<p>Now Hine-nui-te-po was the Great Woman of Night,
the Goddess of Death, who dwelt in the nether world and
dragged down men to herself. But Maui was not afraid,
for he had caught the great Sun himself in a snare and
beaten him and caused him to go so tardily as we now see
him creeping across the sky with leaden steps and slow;
for of old the Sun was wont to speed across the firmament
like a young man rejoicing to run a race. So forth fared
the hero on his great enterprise to snatch the life of mortals
from the very jaws of death. And there came to him to
bear him company the small robin, and the large robin,
and the thrush, and the yellow hammer, and the pied
fantail (<i>tiwakawaka, Rhipidura flabellifora</i>), and every kind
of little bird; and these all assembled together, and they
started with Maui in the evening, and arrived at the
dwelling of Hine-nui-te-po, and found her fast asleep.</p>

<p>Then Maui addressed them all, and said, "My little
friends, now if you see me creep into this old chieftainess,
do not laugh at what you see. Nay, nay, do not, I pray
you, but when I have got altogether inside her, and just as
I am coming out of her mouth, then you may shout with
laughter if you please." But his little friends were frightened
at what they saw, and they answered, "Oh, sir, you will
certainly be killed." And he answered them again, saying,
"If you burst out laughing at me as soon as I get inside
her, you will wake her up, and she will certainly kill me at
once; but if you do not laugh until I am quite inside her,
and am on the point of coming out of her mouth, I shall
live, and Hine-nui-te-po will die." And his little friends
answered, "Go on then, brave sir, but pray take good care
of yourself."</p>

<p>Then the young hero started off, and twisted the strings
of his weapon tight round his wrist, and went into the house,
and stripped off his clothes, and the skin on his hips was as
mottled and beautiful as the skin of a mackerel by reason
of the tattoo marks cut on it with the chisel of Uetongo, and
he entered the old chieftainess. The little birds now screwed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
up their little mouths to keep back their laughter when they
saw him disappearing into the body of the giantess; their
cheeks swelled up and grew purple, and they almost choked
with suppressed emotion. At last the pied fantail could
bear it no longer, and he suddenly exploded with a loud
guffaw. That woke the old woman, she opened her eyes,
and shut her jaws with a snap, cutting the hero clean through
the middle, so that his legs dropped out of her mouth. Thus
died Maui, but before he died he begat children, and sons
were born to him, and some of his descendants are alive to
this day. That, according to Maori tradition, is how death
came into the world; for if only Maui had passed safely
through the jaws of the Goddess of Death, men would have
died no more and death itself would have been destroyed.
Thus the Maoris set down human mortality at the door of
the pied fantail, since but for his unseasonable merriment
we might all have lived for ever.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 4. <i>The Beliefs of the Maoris concerning the Souls
of the Dead</i></h4>

<p>When a chief died, a loud howl or wail announced the
melancholy event, and the neighbours flocked to the scene of
death to testify their sorrow. The wives and near relations,
especially the women, of the deceased displayed their anguish
by cutting their faces, arms, legs, and breasts with flints or
shells till the blood flowed down in streams; it was not
wiped off, for the more the person of a mourner was covered
with clotted gore, the greater was esteemed his or her respect
for the dead. Sometimes relatives would hack off joints of
their fingers as a token of grief. Mourners likewise cut
their hair, the men generally contenting themselves with
clipping or shaving it on one side only, from the forehead to
the neck. The eyes of the dead were closed by the nearest
relative; and the body dressed in the finest mats, decked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
with feathers, and provided with weapons, lay in state for a
time. After the first day a brother of the deceased used to
beat the body with fresh flax gathered for the purpose; this
he did to drive away any evil thing that might be hovering
about the corpse. In the olden time one or more of the
chief's wives would strangle themselves, that their souls
might accompany their dead lord and wait upon him in the
other world, and with the same intentions slaves were killed,
lest the great man should lack attendants in the spirit land.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The body was kept for three days because, we are told,
the soul was believed not to quit its mortal habitation till the
third day.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The mode of disposing of the corpse differed in
different districts and according to the rank of the deceased.
In some places a grave was dug in the house and the body
buried in a sitting posture, the legs being kept in that position
by bandages or doubled up against the chest. In the grave
the dead man retained the fine garments in which he had
been dressed together with the family ornaments of jade
and shark's teeth. With him also was usually interred his
property, especially the clothes which he had worn and
everything else that had touched him during his last illness.
The weapons of a warrior were laid near him that he might
be able to fight his battles in the spirit land. In other places
the corpse was laid in a box on a stage; or two pieces
of an old canoe were set upright in the earth, and in the
hollow between them the body was seated on a grating so
as to allow the products of decomposition to drip through
on the ground. In other places again, the corpse was laid
in a sort of canoe-shaped coffin and deposited among the
branches of a tree in a grove, where it remained for several
months. This burial in the branches of a tree seems to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
have been usually adopted for the bodies of commoners;
the corpses of chiefs, enclosed in coffins, were placed in
mausoleums, carved and painted red, which were raised
on pillars. Whether buried in the earth or placed in
a tree or on a stage, the body was left until the flesh
had so far decayed as to permit of the bones being
easily detached; there was no fixed time allowed for decomposition,
it might vary from three months to six months,
or even a year. When decay was thought to have proceeded
far enough, the bones were dug up or taken down
from the stage or tree and scraped; the ornaments also
were removed from the skeleton and worn by the relatives.
In the south, where the custom was to bury the dead in the
ground, this disinterment took place four weeks after the
burial; the bones were then buried again, but only to be dug
up again after a longer interval, it might be two years, for
the final ceremony. When this took place, all the friends
and relatives of the dead were summoned to assist, and a
great feast was given: the bones were scraped, painted red,
decked with feathers, and wrapped up in mats. The precious
bundle was then deposited in a small canoe or a miniature
house elevated on a pole; or it was carried to the top of
some sacred tree and there left on a small stage. Sometimes
the bones were concealed in a hollow tree in a secret
place of the forest, or hidden away in one of the numerous
limestone caverns or in some lonely and inaccessible chasm
among the rocks. The motive for secret burial was a fear
lest an enemy should get possession of the bones and profane
them by making fish-hooks out of them or converting the
skull into a baler for his canoe. Such a profanation was
deemed a deadly insult to the surviving relatives. After
a burial the persons who had dressed or carried the corpse,
and all indeed who had had anything to do with it, repaired
to the nearest stream and plunged themselves several times
over head in the water.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>In some districts the removal of the bones from their
temporary to their final resting-place was the occasion of
a grand annual festival in which several neighbouring tribes
took part. The bones of all members of the tribes who
had died within the year were taken down from the stages
or trees where the bodies had been temporarily deposited.
The grave-clothes having been removed, the mouldering
remains were wrapped in new blankets and carried in procession,
attended by the crowd, to a place where they were
deposited on a carpet of leaves. Should any putrid flesh
be found still adhering to the bones, it was scraped off and
buried on the spot. A few old women, dressed in their
best, oiled from head to foot, and plastered with raddle,
received the skulls into their laps. While they held them
thus, a funeral ode was sung and speeches, loud and long,
were delivered. Then the bones were tied up, decked with
feathers of the gannet, rolled up in blankets, and carried to
their last place of rest in a sacred grove, where they were
left, securely fastened up and gaudily decorated with red and
white. Having thus discharged their duty to the dead, the
living gave themselves up to festivity; they ate and drank,
danced, sang, whistled, wrestled, quarrelled, bought and sold.
This Holy Fair, which went by the name of Hahunga, lasted
several days. At the end of it the mourners, or revellers,
dispersed and returned to their homes, laden with food
which had been made ready for them by their hosts.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Great
importance was attached to the final disposal of the remains
of the dead. According to one account, the soul of the dead
man could not rest till his bones were laid in the sepulchre
of his ancestors, which was often a natural cave or grotto.
There they were deposited on a shelf or platform a few
feet above the floor of the cavern.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Not uncommonly the bones of the dead, instead of being
preserved, were burned.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> But cremation, though not unusual,
seems never to have been a general custom with the Maoris.
They resorted to it only in exceptional circumstances, for
example, in order to stay the spread of disease, or in cases
where a tribe occupied open country and found no suitable
place where to lay the bones of their dead after exhumation.
Cremation for the latter reason is said to have been practised
by the Ngati-apa tribe in the Rangatikikei District, and also
by the tribes who occupied the Waimate Plains. An old
earthwork fort near the present township of Manaia was the
scene of many cremations of the Maori dead in former days.
Again, it was a common custom for a raiding party to cremate
their dead in the enemy's country, when there was no time
to carry them home for the usual obsequies. The intention
of burning them was to prevent the enemy from eating the
bodies and making fish-hooks out of the bones. For a
similar reason even the wounded, whom they could not carry
with them, were sometimes thrown into great fires and burnt
alive. If the slain man was a chief, only his body would be
consumed in the flames; his head would be cut off, steamed,
cured, and carried home, to be wept over by his friends. In
the Bay of Plenty district the bodies of persons who died of
a certain disease called <i>Kai uaua</i>, apparently consumption,
used to be burnt to prevent the spread of the malady, and
all the ashes were carefully buried.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Often enough the heads of dead relatives were cut off,
dried, and preserved by the family for many years in order
to be occasionally brought forth and mourned over. Sometimes
a widow would sleep with her husband's severed head
at her side. After a victory, too, it was customary to
decapitate the slain foes and dry their heads, which were
then carried home and used as scarecrows or stuck on short
stakes in the village, where they were jeered at and reviled.
When the time came to plant the sweet potatoes, and the
priests recited their spells for the sake of the crops, the dried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
heads were sometimes brought out and placed at the edge
of the field, for this was believed to promote the growth of
the sweet potatoes.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Apparently the spirits of the dead
were thought able to quicken the fruits of the earth.</p>

<p>At all events the Maoris undoubtedly believed that the
souls of the departed survive the death of their bodies for a
longer or shorter time and in their disembodied state can
influence the living for weal or woe. The belief in the
survival of the soul is strikingly manifested in their old
custom of killing widows and slaves to serve dead chiefs in
the other world. It found expression in the more harmless
custom of laying food beside a dead person or burying it
with him in the grave; but, as usually happens in such
cases, the ghost only consumed the spiritual essence of the
victuals, considerately leaving the gross material substance
to be despatched by the priest.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> A dying Maori, unable to
eat a loaf which a missionary had offered to him, begged
that it might be kept for his ghost, who, after his death,
would come and fortify himself with it for the journey to his
long home.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> At Tanaraki the child of a chief was buried in
its father's house, grasping in each of its little fists a taro for
consumption in the other world. Over the grave were laid
boards, and the family slept on them. When they thought
that the child's body was sufficiently decayed, they dug it
up, scraped the bones, and hung them in the verandah,
where from time to time the priest recited spells to assist
the soul in its ascent to heaven. Every spell was supposed
to raise the soul one stage nearer to the abode of bliss.
But the ascent was long and tedious, for there were no less
than ten heavens one above the other; the tenth was believed
to be the principal abode of the gods. When the parents
of the child who had been despatched to the happy land
with taro in each hand were asked, "Why taro, if the little
one is gone to heaven?" they answered that they were not
quite sure whether it went up or down, and therefore as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
an additional precaution they planted a seed of taro in
the grave, so that their offspring might find something to
eat either above or below.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Similar ceremonies were performed to facilitate the
ascension of the souls of chiefs and priests. Before the
body was taken to the place of burial, it was laid out with
its feet towards the north, and all the blood-relations of
the deceased, men, women, and children, assembled round
it. Then the priest, standing at the head of the corpse,
between the rows of the people, chanted two incantations,
of which the second was supposed to assist the soul to
ascend to heaven. The priest next put a bulb of taro in
the left hand of the corpse and chanted another incantation.
After that, flaxen cords were tied with a slip-knot to a
tassel of the mat in which the body was enshrouded, and a
cord was placed in the hand of each child, boy and girl,
present at the ceremony. When the priest had chanted
one more incantation, each child pulled the cord with a jerk,
to disconnect the soul from the body, lest it should remain
and afflict the relatives.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This last rite, with the reason
assigned for it, is significant at once of the dread which the
Maoris felt for departed spirits, and of the very materialistic
conception which they entertained of the human soul, since
they appear to have imagined that it could be detached
from the body by jerking at a cord.</p>

<p>The wish to raise the soul to heaven was perhaps the
motive for another curious rite performed at the obsequies
of a chief. When the body had been buried, the chief
returned to the village; but the men who had carried the
body went to the nearest swamp, and having caught a
swamp-sparrow (<i>matata</i>) sent word to the priest, who forthwith
rejoined them. Each of the bearers was then provided
with a stick to which certain of the feathers of the bird were
tied. Then, holding the sticks in their hands, they sat on
their heels in a row opposite the priest, who stood facing the
east with a stick similarly adorned in his left hand. Next
he moved to the south end of the row of men and chanted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and as he chanted he gradually raised his stick, while at the
same time all the bearers, holding their sticks at arm's
length, gradually raised them and their bodies simultaneously,
keeping perfect time, till the priest had concluded his chant,
when they all stood erect with outstretched arms. After
that the priest collected the sticks and threw them down in
front of the <i>mua</i>, which seems to have been a kind of altar.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
We may surmise that the ceremony was intended to waft
the soul of the dead chief upward, the feathers of the bird
being naturally fitted to facilitate its heavenward flight.</p>

<p>At other times, however, with the inconsistency so
common in such matters, it appears to have been supposed
that the soul set out on its far journey across the sea, and
steps were accordingly taken to equip it for the voyage.
Thus we hear of a <i>wahi tapu</i> or sacred repository of the
property of a deceased chief, which contained, among other
things, a little canoe with sail and paddles, "to serve as a
ferry-boat for the spirit to enter in safety into the eternal
abodes." Nevertheless in the same enclosure, which was
fenced with a double set of palings, "calabashes of food
and water, and a dish prepared from the pigeon, were placed
for the ghost to regale itself when visiting the spot; and
the heathen natives aver that at night the spirit comes and
feeds from the sacred calabashes."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Many people in the Taranaki district thought that souls
went neither up nor down, but always stayed near their
mouldering bodies. Hence the sacred grove in which their
remains were buried was full of disembodied spirits; and
when a man died a violent death his soul wandered about
disconsolate, till a priest by his spells and enchantments
had brought the poor ghost within the spiritual fold.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>When a chief was killed in battle and eaten by his foes,
as often happened, his departed spirit entered the stones of
the oven in which his body had been cooked, and the stones
retained their heat so long as the ghost was in them. Meanwhile
his sorrowing friends at home recited their most potent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
spells to draw his soul out of the oven and back to the
sacred grove (<i>wahi tapu</i>) the burial-place of his people; for
otherwise the soul could find no repose, but must roam about
for ever, wreaking its spite on the living, for all disembodied
spirits were deemed malicious. Hence after a battle, if
people could not obtain the body of a slain friend, they
sought to procure at least some drops of his blood or shreds
of his raiment, that by crooning over them the appropriate
spell they might draw home the vagrant spirit to his place
of rest. The burial-grounds were regarded with awe and
fear, for sometimes a restless ghost would break bounds and
spread sickness among the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.
Within their sacred precincts stood altars or stages for offerings
to the gods, and any living man who entered them did
so at his peril. For the same reason no one would set foot
in a house where a dead man or woman had been buried.
Hence in nearly every village half the houses stood empty
and deserted, falling into decay, tenanted only by ghosts.
The living had constantly before their eyes the mansions of
the dead.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The common belief of the Maoris seems to have been
that the souls of the dead pass away to a region of the
underworld, which was sometimes called Po and sometimes
Reinga. Properly speaking, Po was night or the primaeval
darkness out of which all forms of life and light were
evolved or created;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and Reinga was not so much the spirit
land itself as the leaping-off place where the souls bade
good-bye to earth and took their departure for the far
country. This leaping-off place was at the North Cape, the
Land's End of New Zealand. The cape terminates in a
steep cliff with a sea-cave at its foot, into which the tide
rushes with a thunderous roar. There the evil spirit Wiro is
thought to dwell, lurking for his prey; for he battens on
such of the passing souls of the dead as he can get into his
clutches. On their passage to the North Cape the ghosts
stop by the way at two hills; at the first, which is called
Wai-hokimai, they wail, cut themselves, and strip off their
clothes; at the second, which is called Wai-otioti, they turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
their backs on the land of the living and set their faces
to the land of the dead. Arrived at the cape they pass outward
over a long narrow ledge of rock and then leap down
on a flat stone. There they see a mass of sea-weed floating
on the water, its roots hidden in the depth, its upper
branches clinging to a <i>pohutukawa</i> tree. When they perceive
an opening in the sea-weed they dive and soon find
themselves in the lower world. But before they reach the
abode of spirits they must cross a river by a plank; the
river is called Waiorotane or the River of the Water of
Life; and sometimes the warden of the plank will not suffer
the ghosts to pass the river, but drives them back with
friendly violence and bids them return to their friends on
earth. Such souls come back to the bright world of light
and life, and tell their friends what they have seen and
heard on the journey to that bourne from which so many
travellers return no more. Hence when any one has recovered
from a dangerous sickness or escaped some great
peril, they say of him that he has come back from the
River of the Water of Life. Even if a soul has crossed
that sombre stream, he may still return to the land of
the living, if only he refuses to partake of the food set
before him by the ghosts; but should he taste of it, he
cannot come back. They say that people living near the
North Cape can hear the spirits of the dead passing through
the air on their way to the spirit land; and in the old days,
when a battle had been fought and before the news of it
could reach them by word of mouth, the natives near the
cape were made aware of what had happened by the rushing
sound of a great multitude flitting by overhead in the darkness.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Perhaps the sighing of the night-wind or the
clangour of birds of passage winging their way out to sea
may have contributed to create or foster these fancies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>On the day after a burial the priest used to perform a
ceremony to facilitate the passage of the soul to its final
rest. For this purpose some men would go out in the
morning and kill a small bird of the swamps called <i>kokata</i>
and pluck up some reeds of a certain sort (<i>wiwi</i>). These
they brought to the priest at the grave. He asked them,
"Whence came ye?" They answered, "From the seeking,
from the searching." He asked them again, "Ah! what
have you got? ah! what have you gained?" Then the
men threw the bird and the reeds on the ground. Next the
priest chose a stalk of grass or fern and put it near the
grave in a direction pointing towards Hawaiki, the land far
away from which the forefathers of the Maoris came long
ago. Another stalk of grass or fern was laid near the place
of death, and along these stalks the soul of the dead man
travelled to rejoin his friends and kinsfolk who had gone
before.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>As might be anticipated, the accounts which the Maoris
gave of the spirit world and of life in it were neither
clear nor consistent. According to one account, while the
heavens increase in beauty as they ascend one above the
other, the lower regions increase in darkness and horror
as they descend, each being darker and worse than the one
above it, till in the lowest of all complete darkness reigns.
There the souls, deprived alike of light and food, wasted
away and ultimately ceased to exist; or according to another
account they assumed the shape of worms and in that guise
returned to earth, where they died a second death and so
finally perished. But it was only the souls of common folk
which came to this melancholy end. Chiefs and priests
were believed to be descended from the gods, and at death
their souls ascended to heaven, there to live for ever.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Other reports, however, paint the nether world in more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
cheerful colours. We are told that the souls of the dead live
there very much as people do on earth, but all good things
are more plentiful there than here. The staple food of the
ghosts is sweet potatoes, and the quality of the potatoes
appears to be remarkably fine; for once a woman, who had
the good fortune to go to the spirit land and come back, received
from her dead father in the nether regions two roots
of sweet potatoes of a most prodigious size. These the
ghost told her to take back to earth and plant for the
benefit of his grandchild. So she hurried away with them
and arriving at the foot of the North Cape had begun to
clamber up the face of the cliff, when two infant spirits overtook
her and attempted to drag her back to dead land by
tugging at her cloak. To divert their attention she threw
the two roots of sweet potato behind her, and while the
sprites were munching them she made good her escape up
the cliff and succeeded in reaching home. Her friends were
very glad to see her again, but they always lamented that
she had not brought back at least one of those gigantic
roots of sweet potato, since it would unquestionably have
done much to improve the quality of sweet potatoes grown
here on earth.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>But the spirits of the dead are by no means strictly
confined to the lower world; they can quit it from time
to time and return to earth, there to influence the actions
and fortunes of the living and to communicate with them
through the priest, who can hear their voices. They speak
in whistling tones, which even common folk can sometimes
distinguish as they walk about in the dark. Often their
communications are made to the priest or chief in dreams,
and he announces the glad or mournful tidings to other
people in the morning. Any commands conveyed in this
manner from the other world are, or used to be, implicitly
obeyed and might decide the course to be pursued in the
most important affairs of life.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In some tribes, especially
among the natives of Wangunui, it used to be customary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to keep in the houses small carved images of wood, each
of them dedicated to an ancestor of the family, who was
believed occasionally to enter into the image in order to
hold converse with his living descendants.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> But even without
the intervention of such images the priest could summon
up the spirits of the dead and converse with them in the
presence of the relatives or of strangers; at these interviews,
which were held within doors and in the dark, the voices of
the ghosts, or perhaps of the priestly ventriloquist, were
sometimes distinctly audible even to sceptical Europeans.
Nor was the art of necromancy confined to men; for we
read of an old woman who, like the witch of Endor, professed
to exercise this ghostly office, and treated an English
visitor to an exhibition of her powers.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The spirits of the dead were sometimes useful to the
living, for commonly enough they would appear to their
kinsfolk in dreams and warn them of approaching foes or
other dangers. Again, they might be and were invoked
by spells and enchantments to avenge a murder or even to
slay an innocent person against whom the enchanter had
a grudge.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> But for the most part the ghosts were greatly
dreaded as malicious demons who worked harm to man.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Even the nearest and dearest relations were believed to
have their natures radically changed by death and to hate
those whom they had loved in life.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And so powerful were
these malignant beings supposed to be that they were confused
with the gods, or rather the spirits of the dead became
themselves gods to all intents and purposes, and played a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
much more important part in the religious life of the Maoris
than the high primaeval deities, the personifications of
nature, who figured in Maori mythology and cosmogony.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
The gods whom the Maoris feared, we are told, were the
spirits of the dead, who were believed to be constantly
watching over the living with jealous eyes, lest they should
neglect any part of the law relating to persons or things
subject to the sacred restriction called taboo (<i>tapu</i>). These
spirits, however, confined their care almost exclusively to
persons among the living with whom they were connected
by ties of relationship, so that every tribe and every family
had its own worshipful ancestral spirit or god, whom
members of the tribe or family invoked with appropriate
prayers or spells (<i>karakias</i>). Ancestral spirits who lived
in the flesh before the Maoris emigrated to New Zealand
were invoked by all the tribes in New Zealand without
distinction, so far as their names and memories survived
in tradition. Thus the worship of these remote
ancestors constituted what may be called the national
religion of the Maoris as distinguished from the tribal and
family religions, which consisted in the worship of nearer
and better remembered progenitors. The great importance
attached by the Maoris to the worship of ancestors
may account, we are told, for the care with which they
preserved their genealogies; since the names of ancestors
often formed the groundwork of their religious formulas
(<i>karakias</i>), and any error or even hesitation in repeating these
prayers or incantations was deemed fatal to their efficacy.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
"Ancestor worship, or rather the deification of ancestors,
was essentially a Maori cult. It was a form of necrolatry,
or hero worship. A man would placate the spirit of his
father, grandfather, or ancestor, and make offerings to the
same, that such spirit might protect his life principle, warn
him of approaching danger, and give force or effectiveness
to his rites and charms of black or white magic."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The ancestral spirits who particularly watched over the
fortunes of a tribe were the souls of its dead warriors and
great men. In war these powerful, though invisible, beings
were thought to attend the army and direct its movements
on the march by communicating advice or warning through
some one or other of their nearest living kinsmen. In battle
they hovered over the combatants and inspired courage into
the hearts of their own tribe. Hence when, on the eve of
battle, any young man showed signs of the white feather,
recourse was immediately had to the family priest, who repeated
a charm, invoking the aid of his friendly spirit; for the
sensation of fear was ascribed to the baneful influence of a
hostile spirit. If the friendly spirit prevailed, and the craven
spirit was expelled, the young man would rush into the thickest
of the fight and prove himself the bravest of the brave.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>The interest taken by the spirits of the dead in mundane
affairs seldom extended beyond the limits of the tribe to
which they belonged. Hence a captive in war, who was
carried away and enslaved by another tribe, ceased from that
moment to be under the protection and care of any ancestral
spirit or god. For the ancestral spirits of his own tribe did
not trouble themselves to follow him among a hostile tribe
and hostile spirits, and the ancestral spirits of the tribe whom
he served as a slave would not deign to give him a thought.
Hence being forsaken of god and left to their own devices,
slaves were relieved from many of the burdensome restrictions
which the Maori gods laid upon their worshippers;
they were therefore free to perform many menial offices,
particularly in regard to carrying and cooking food, which
no free Maori could discharge without sinning against the
sacred law of taboo and incurring the wrath of the ancestral
spirits, who for such a transgression might punish the sinner
with sickness or death.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>In addition to their deified ancestors, who had lived as
men of flesh and blood on earth, the Maoris believed in
certain great primaeval deities, who had existed before the
human race came into being, and whose doings were the
theme of many mythical stories. These mighty beings appear
to have been personifications of the various forces or elements
of nature, such as the sky and the earth. But though fancy
wove round them a glistering web of myth and fable, they
were apparently believed to stand aloof in cold abstraction
from human affairs and to take no interest in the present
race of men. The practical religion of the Maori was concentrated
on the souls of his deceased kinsfolk and forefathers:
"neither in any existing superstition nor tradition,
purely such, is there to be found internal evidence that an
idea of God existed more exalted than that of the spirit of a
dead ancestor."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>The word which the Maoris applied to a god, whether
a personification of nature or the spirit of a dead ancestor,
was <i>atua</i>. The name is not confined to the Maori language,
but is the common word for god throughout Polynesia.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
When the Maoris attempt to define the nature of an <i>atua</i>,
they have recourse to the same comparisons with a shadow
and with breath which appear to underlie their conception
of the human soul.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> But though "god" is the nearest
English equivalent of the word <i>atua</i>, we must beware of
assuming that the Maori idea of godhead coincided with
ours. On this subject one of our best authorities tells us
that the term "god" is really not applicable to the <i>Atua
Maori</i>, the so-called gods of the Maoris. For these beings,
he says, "were, with few exceptions, malignant demons, to
be feared and placated or conciliated, but not worshipped.
Their principal task seems to have been the inflicting upon
mankind of diverse evils, pains, and penalties. Of the few
good offices performed by them, the warning of the people
in regard to coming troubles, seems to have been the most
important. The vast majority of the so-called gods of the
Maori were simply deified ancestors."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>In order to illustrate the difference between the Maori
conception of deity and our own, I will quote the words of
another eminent authority on the native religion of the New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Zealanders. He says, "Before the mythology of the Maori
is further considered, it will be necessary briefly to state what
were the ideas of God entertained by the natives. The word
<i>atua</i>, or spirit, which is used for God, formerly had various
significations; a plague or disease was also <i>he atua</i>, or God;
a thief was an <i>atua</i>, thus also a thievish dog was <i>he kuri atua</i>,
a god-like dog, so also <i>he tangata atua ki te muru</i>, a man equal
to a god in stealing; a child who pilfered was <i>he tamaiti atua</i>,
a divine child; there were great spirits and small ones, a
man's spirit was an <i>atua pore pore</i>, a little spirit, but Maru
Rongomai and other gods were <i>Atua nui</i>, great gods; there
were <i>atua ika</i>, reptile or fish gods; a great chief was called
<i>He ika</i>, a fish, sea monster, or reptile, and was regarded as
a malignant god in life, and a still worse one after death;
there were likewise <i>Atua marau</i>, as the <i>toroa</i>, albatross, the
<i>ruru</i>, owl; and <i>karu karu</i>, the film which shades its eye
from the light, was also an <i>atua</i>; male and female spirits presided
over dreams, and were regarded as <i>atuas, Ko nga atua
moe moea o te poko</i>, the gods of dreams; <i>Tunui a rangi</i>, a male,
<i>Pare kewa</i>, a female deity, both were prayed to as gods; the
<i>atua kore</i> and <i>atua kiko kiko</i> were inferior gods. The <i>Atua
ngarara</i> or reptile gods were very abundant, and were supposed
to be the cause of all diseases and death, being always
ready to avail themselves of every opportunity of crawling
down the throat during sleep, and thus preying upon the lives
of unfortunate creatures. <i>Atuas</i> or spirits of the deceased
were thought to be able to revisit the earth and reveal to
their friends the cause of their sickness. Everything that
was evil or noxious was supposed especially to belong to the
gods; thus a species of euphorbium, whose milk or juice is
highly poisonous, is called <i>wai u atua</i>, the milk of the gods."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
"In fact, in the accounts which the natives give of their
gods and their exploits, we have but a magnified history of
their chiefs, their wars, murders, and lusts, with the addition
of some supernatural powers; they were cannibals; influenced
by like feelings and passions as men, and were uniformly
bad; to them were ascribed all the evils incident to the
human race; each disease was supposed to be occasioned by
a different god, who resided in the part affected; thus, Tonga,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the god who caused headache, took up his abode in the
forehead; Moko Titi, a lizard god, was the source of all
pains in the breast; Tu-tangata-kino was the god of the
stomach; Titihai occasioned pains in the ankles and feet;
Rongomai and Tuparitapua were the gods of consumption,
and the wasting away of the legs and arms; Koro-kio-ewe
presided over childbirth, and did his worst to unfortunate
females in that state. In fact, the entire human body
appears to have been shared out amongst those evil beings,
who ruled over each part, to afflict and pain the poor
creatures who worshipped them."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Anything, indeed, whether good or evil, which excited
the fear or wonder of the Maoris would seem in the old days
to have been dubbed by them an <i>atua</i> and invested with the
attributes of divinity. For example, when a traveller in the
early years of the nineteenth century showed his watch to
some Maoris, the ticking struck them with such astonishment
that they deemed it nothing less than the voice of a
god; and the watch itself, being looked upon as a deity
(<i>atua</i>) in person, was treated by the whole of them with
profound reverence.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Other travellers have had similar experiences
among the Maoris,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and compasses and barometers
have also been accorded divine honours by these ignorant
savages.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 5. <i>Taboo among the Maoris</i></h4>

<p>But the most momentous practical consequence which
flowed from their belief in the spirits of the dead was the
enormous influence which that creed wielded in establishing
and maintaining the system of taboo, the most remarkable
and characteristic institution in the life of the Maoris and
of the Polynesians in general. I shall first give some
account of the taboo or <i>tapu</i>, as the Maoris called it, and
afterwards show how this extraordinary system of society
and religion was directly based on a belief in the existence
of ghosts and their mighty power over human destiny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>First, then, as to taboo or <i>tapu</i> itself. This curious
institution, as I have said, prevailed throughout all the
widely scattered islands of Polynesia, but nowhere to a
greater extent than in New Zealand. It pervaded the
whole life of the natives, affected their plans, influenced
their actions, and in the absence of an efficient police
provided a certain security both for their persons and their
property. Sometimes it was used for political, and sometimes
for religious purposes; sometimes it was the means of
saving life, and at other times it was the ostensible reason
for taking life away.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> It may be defined as a system of
consecration which made any person, place, or thing sacred
either permanently or for a limited time.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The effect of
this consecration was to separate the sacred person or thing
from all contact with common (<i>noa</i>)<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> persons and things:
it established a sort of quarantine for the protection not
only of the sacred persons themselves, but of common folk,
who were supposed to be injured or killed by mere contact
with a tabooed person or object. For the sanctity which
the taboo conferred on people and things was conceived of
as a sort of dangerous atmosphere, charged with a spiritual
electricity, which discharged itself with serious and even
fatal effect on all rash intruders. A tabooed person might
not be touched by any one, so long as the taboo or state of
consecration lasted; he might not even put his own hand
to his own head; and he was most stringently forbidden
to touch food with his hands. Hence he was either fed
like a child by another, who put the food into his mouth;
or he had to lap up his victuals like a dog from the ground,
with his hands held behind his back; or lastly he might
convey the nourishment by means of a fern stalk to his
mouth. When he wished to drink, somebody else poured
water into his mouth from a calabash without allowing the
vessel to touch his lips; for mere contact with the lips of
the tabooed man would have rendered the vessel itself
sacred or tabooed and therefore unfit for common use.
Similarly, when he desired to wash his hands, water had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
be poured on them from a distance by his attendant. This
state of consecration or defilement, as we might be tempted
rather to call it, was incurred by any person who had
touched either a young child or a corpse or had assisted
at a funeral. The taboo contracted by association with the
dead was the strictest and most virulent of all. It extended
not only to the persons who had handled the corpse
or paid the last offices of respect to the departed; it applied
to the place where the body was buried or the bones
deposited. So sacred, indeed, was deemed the spot where
a chief had died that in the old days everything upon it
was destroyed by fire. Hence in order to avoid the destruction
of a house, which a death in it would have entailed,
it was customary to remove a sick or dying man to a
temporary shed just large enough to shelter him from the
sun or screen him from the rain; for if the man died in it,
the destruction of the wretched hovel was no great loss to
the survivors.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> A widow was tabooed and had to observe
the aforesaid restrictions from the death of her husband
until his bones had been scraped and deposited in their last
resting-place; and the same rule applied to a widower.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
These taboos were temporary and could be removed by a
priest, who performed certain rites and repeated certain
spells (<i>karakias</i>), and thereby relieved the tabooed person
from the state of sanctity or consecration under which he
had laboured. The performance of the ceremony put an
end to the spiritual quarantine; the man ceased to be
sacred, he became common (<i>noa</i>) once more, and could
mingle freely with his fellows. One of the ceremonies of
desecration, as we may call it, was to pass a consecrated
piece of wood over the right shoulder of the tabooed person,
then round his loins, and back again over the left shoulder,
after which the stick was broken in two and buried, burned,
or cast into the sea.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Again, a temporary taboo was laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
on all persons who were engaged in planting sweet potatoes,
or in sorting the seed, or in digging and preparing the
ground; they might not leave the fields where they were at
work nor undertake any other labour. The fields themselves
were sacred during these operations; none but the
persons who were tabooed for the purpose might set foot
on the ground or pluck up the weeds which grow rankly
round the roots of the vegetable.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Similarly, in their great
fishing-expeditions to catch mackerel, all concerned in
making or mending the nets were under a taboo: the
ground where the nets were made was sacred, and so was
the river on the banks of which the work went on. No
man but the tabooed persons might walk over the land or
pass up or down the river in a canoe: no fire might be
lighted within a prescribed distance: no food might be
dressed while the taboo lasted. Not till the net had been
finished and wetted with the sacred water, and the owner
had caught and eaten a fish, did these burdensome restrictions
come to an end by the removal of the taboo.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Once
more, the men who took part in a warlike expedition were
under a severe taboo and had to observe very strictly the
customs which that mysterious state of consecration rendered
obligatory.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Even after their return home they were not
allowed to enter their houses or to hold any direct communication
with their families who had remained there, till
they had been rendered common (<i>noa</i>) by a ceremony of
desecration. Before that ceremony took place, the warriors
were obliged to throw away the remains of the bodies of
their foes on which, as usual, they had been feasting; for
being sacred food the flesh could only be touched by sacred
or tabooed persons. One woman only, the <i>wahine ariki</i>, as
she was called, that is the elder female of the elder branch
of the stock from which the tribe traced their descent, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
permitted to touch the sanctified meat; indeed, in order
to carry out the ritual of desecration in due form she was
expected and required to swallow an ear of the first enemy
killed in battle.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> A warlike expedition might lay even
people at home under a taboo; for all who remained
behind, including old men, women, and slaves, were often
required to observe a rigid fast and to abstain from smoking
till the return of the warriors.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>But in contrast to the temporary taboos which affected
common folk and debarred them for a time from familiar
intercourse with their fellows, a perpetual and very stringent
taboo was laid on the persons and property of chiefs,
especially of those high hereditary chiefs who bore the title
of <i>Ariki</i> and were thought to be able at any time to hold
visible converse with their dead ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Strictly
speaking, "the <i>ariki</i> of a Maori tribe is the senior male
descendant of the elder branch of the tribe, that is, he
is a descendant of the elder son of the elder son of each
generation from the time of the original ancestor down to
the present day. As such, he was of old regarded almost
as a god, inasmuch as he represented all that there was of
<i>m&#259;na</i> and sacredness of his tribe. That he should have
been regarded in this light is not astonishing, for the Maoris
believed he was something more than human, in that he
was the shrine of an hereditary <i>Atua</i>, the guardian spirit of
the tribe, and could therefore at any time communicate with
the tribal gods.... Such a man was not only <i>tapu</i> in
person but he made everything he touched so dangerously
sacred as to be a source of terror to the tribe. To smoke
his pipe, or drink from any vessel he had touched, was death
speedy and certain at the hands of the gods, who avenge
breaches of the <i>tapu</i>."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> "The gods being no more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
deceased chiefs, the <i>arikis</i> were regarded as living ones, and
thus were not to be killed by inferior men, but only by
those who had more powerful <i>atuas</i> in them; the victorious
chief who had slain numbers, swallowed their eyes, and
drunk their blood, was supposed to have added the spirits
of his victims to his own, and thus increased his <i>mana</i> or
power; to keep up this idea, and hinder the lower orders
from trying whether it were possible to kill such corporeal
and living gods, was the grand work of the <i>tapu</i>."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The
godhead of a chief was thought to reside in his eyes,
especially in his left eye; that was why by swallowing the
eye or eyes of a slain chief a living chief was believed to
absorb the divine spirit of the dead man and thereby to
strengthen his own divinity; the more eyes he swallowed,
the greater god he became.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Every such divine chief was under a permanent taboo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
he was as it were surrounded by an atmosphere of sanctity
which attached to his person and never left him; it was his
birthright, a part of himself of which he could not be
divested, and it was well understood and recognised by
everybody at all times. And the sanctity was not confined
to his person, it was an infection which extended or was
communicated to all his movable property, especially to
his clothes, weapons, ornaments, and tools, indeed to everything
which he touched. Even the petty chiefs and fighting
men, everybody indeed who could claim the title of
<i>rangatira</i> or gentleman, possessed in some degree this
mysterious quality.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> However, in young people of rank
the sanctity which appertained to them by virtue of their
birth was supposed to be only latent; it did not develop or
burst into full bloom till they had reached mature age and
set up house on their own account. Hence noble boys and
lads were under none of the irksome restrictions to which
in their adult years they were afterwards bound to submit;
they mixed freely with the profane vulgar and did not even
disdain to carry fuel or provisions on their backs, a thing
which no man of any standing could possibly do; at all
events, if he did so demean himself, the food was thereby
rendered taboo and could accordingly be used by nobody
but himself. "If he went into the shed used as a kitchen
(a thing, however, he would never think of doing except on
some great emergency), all the pots, ovens, food, etc., would
be at once rendered useless&mdash;none of the cooks or inferior
people could make use of them, or partake of anything
which had been cooked in them. He might certainly light
a little fire in his own house, not for cooking, as that never
by any chance could be done in his house, but for warmth;
but that, or any other fire, if he should have blown upon it
with his breath in lighting it, became at once <i>tapu</i>, and
could be used for no common or culinary purpose. Even
to light a pipe at it would subject any inferior person, or in
many instances an equal, to a terrible attack of the <i>tapu
morbus</i>, besides being a slight or affront to the dignity of
the person himself. I have seen two or three young men
fairly wearing themselves out on a wet day and with bad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
apparatus trying to make fire to cook with, by rubbing two
sticks together, when on a journey, and at the same time
there was a roaring fire close at hand at which several
<i>rangatira</i> and myself were warming ourselves, but it was
<i>tapu</i>, or sacred fire&mdash;one of the <i>rangatira</i> had made it from
his own tinder-box, and blown upon it in lighting it, and as
there was not another tinder-box amongst us, fast we must,
though hungry as sharks, till common culinary fire could be
obtained."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The head of a chief was always and at all times deemed
most sacred, and in consequence he might not even touch it
with his own hand; if he chanced to commit the sacrilege,
he was obliged at once to apply his fingers to his sacred
nose and to snuff up the odour of sanctity which they had
abstracted, thus restoring the holy effluvium to the place
from which it had been taken.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> For the same reason the
cutting of a chief's hair was a most difficult and delicate
operation. While it lasted neither the great man himself
nor the barber who operated on him was allowed to do anything
or partake of any food except under the restrictions
imposed on all sacred or tabooed persons; to use the scissors
or the shell, with which the operation was performed, for any
other purpose or any other person would have been a terrible
profanation of sacred things, and would have rendered the
rash sacrilegious wretch, who had dared so to appropriate it,
liable to the severest punishment. The severed hair was
collected and buried or hung up on a tree,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> probably to put
it out of the way of common folk, who might have been
struck dead by contact with the holy locks. But apparently
the dangers incident to hair-cutting were by no means confined
to chiefs, but extended to any one who was bold
enough to submit his head to the barber's shears; for one
of the early writers on the Maoris tells us that "he who has
had his hair cut is in the immediate charge of the <i>Atua</i>; he
is removed from the contact and society of his family and
his tribe; he dare not touch his food himself; it is put into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
his mouth by another person; nor can he for some days
resume his accustomed occupations, or associate with his
fellow-men."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The hair of the first-born of a family in
particular, on account of his extreme sanctity, might be cut
by nobody but a priest; and for many days after the
operation had been performed the priestly barber was in a
state of strict taboo. He could do nothing for himself, and
might not go near anybody. He might not touch food
with his hands, and no less than three persons were required
to feed him. One of them prepared the food at a safe
distance, took it to a certain place, and retired; a second
came forward, picked up the victuals, carried them to
another spot and left them; finally, a third, venturing into
the danger zone, actually brought the food to the priest and
put it into his mouth.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The atmosphere of taboo or sanctity which thus surrounded
Maori chiefs and gentlemen not only imposed many
troublesome and inconvenient restraints on the men themselves,
it was also frequently a source of very real danger, loss,
and annoyance to other people. For example, it was a rule
that a chief should not blow on a fire with his mouth, because
his breath being sacred would communicate its sanctity to the
fire, and if a slave or a common man afterwards cooked food
at the fire or merely took a brand from it, the chief's holiness
would cause that man's death.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Again, if the blood of a
high chief flowed on anything, though it were but a single
drop, it rendered the thing sacred to him, so that it could be
used by nobody else. Thus it once happened that a party
of natives came in a fine new canoe to pay their respects to
an eminent chief; the great man stepped into the canoe,
and in doing so he chanced to strike a splinter into his foot,
which bled. That sufficed to consecrate the canoe to him.
The owner at once leaped out, drew the canoe ashore opposite
to the chief's house and left it there.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Again, a Maori gentleman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
visiting a missionary, knocked his head against a beam
in the house, and his sacred blood was spilt. The natives
present thereupon told the missionary that in former times
his house would after such an accident have belonged to his
noble visitor.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Even the cast garments of a chief had acquired,
by contact with his holy body, so virulent a degree of sanctity
that they would kill anybody else who might happen in
ignorance to find and wear them. On a journey, when a
chief found his blanket too heavy to carry, he has been
known to throw it very considerately down a precipice where
nobody would be likely to light on it, lest some future
traveller should be struck dead by appropriating the sacred
garment. Once a chief's lost tinder-box actually caused the
death of several persons; for having found it and used it to
light their pipes, they literally died of fright on learning
the sacrilege which they had committed.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Such fatal effects
consequent on the discovery of a breach of taboo were not
uncommon among the Maoris. For instance, a woman once
ate some peaches which, though she did not know it, had
been taken from a tabooed place. As soon as she heard
where the fruit had come from, the basket which she was
carrying dropped from her hands, and she exclaimed in
agony that the spirit (<i>atua</i>) of the chief whose sanctuary had
thus been profaned would kill her. That happened in the
afternoon, and next day by twelve o'clock she was dead.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
Again, a slave, a strong man in the prime of life, once found
the remains of a chief's dinner beside the road, and being
hungry ate it up without asking any questions. No sooner,
however, did he hear to whom the food had belonged than
he was seized with the most extraordinary convulsions and
cramps in the stomach, which never ceased till he died about
sundown the same day. The English eyewitness who reports
the case adds, that any European freethinker who should have
denied that the man was killed by the chief's taboo would
have been listened to by the Maoris with feelings of contempt
for his ignorance and inability to understand plain and direct
evidence.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>In order that a thing should be consecrated or tabooed
to the exclusive use and possession of a chief, it was not
necessary that his sacred blood should flow on it, or that he
should merely touch it; he had only to call it his head, or
his back-bone, or any other part of his body, and at once
the thing, by a legal fiction, became his and might be
appropriated by nobody else under pain of violating the
taboo which the chief had laid upon it. For example,
when a chief desired to prevent a piece of ground from
being cultivated by any one but himself, he often resorted
to the expedient of calling it his back-bone; after that if
any man dared to set foot on the land so consecrated, the
transgression was equivalent to a declaration of war. In this
simple and easy fashion a chief might acquire anything that
took his fancy from an axe or a canoe to a landed estate,
and the rightful owner of the property dared not complain
nor dispute the claim of his superior.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless in daily life even ordinary people used the
taboo to secure their property or to acquire for themselves
what had hitherto been common to all. For example, if a
man found a piece of drift timber, he could make it his own
by tying something to it or giving it a chop with his axe;
he thereby set his taboo on the log, and as a general rule
the taboo would be respected. Again, with a simple piece
of flax he might bar the door of his house or his store of
food; the contents of the house or store were thus rendered
inviolable, nobody would meddle with them.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to see that this form of taboo must have
greatly contributed to create and confirm respect for the
rights of private property. The most valuable articles
might, we are told, under ordinary circumstances be left to
its protection in the absence of the owners for any length of
time.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Indeed so obvious and so useful is this function of
taboo that one well-informed writer supposes the original
purpose of the institution to have been no other than the
preservation of private property;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and another observer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
after eulogising its beneficent effects, declares that "it was
undoubtedly the ordinance of a wise legislator."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> But to
say this is greatly to overrate the wisdom and foresight of
primitive man in general and of the Polynesians in particular;
it implies a fundamental misconception of the real
nature and history of taboo. That curious institution was
not the creation of a prudent and sagacious legislator, who
devised this system of checks and restrictions for the purpose
of curbing the passions of a savage race and inducing
them to submit to the salutary restraints of law and
morality. It was in its origin, I believe, simply a crude
and barbarous form of superstition, which, like many other
superstitions, has accidentally led to good results that were
never contemplated by its ignorant and foolish votaries. It
is thus that in the long history of mankind things which to
a contemporary spectator might seem to be almost unmitigated
evils turn out in the end to be fraught with incalculable
good to humanity. This experience, often repeated,
enables students of the past to look forward, even in the
darkest hours, with cheerful confidence to the future.</p>

<p>The particular superstition which lies at the root of taboo
and has incidentally exercised a beneficent influence by
inspiring a respect for law and morality appears to be a
belief in the existence of ghosts and their power to affect the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
fortunes of the living for good or evil. For the ultimate
sanction of the taboo, in other words, that which engaged the
people to observe its commandments, was a firm persuasion
that any breach of these commandments would surely and
speedily be punished by an <i>atua</i> or ghost, who would afflict
the sinner with a painful malady till he died. From youth
upwards the Maori was bred in the faith that the souls of his
dead ancestors, jealous of any infraction of the traditionary
rites, would commission some spirit of their kin to enter into
the transgressor's body and prey on a vital part. The visible
signs of this hidden and mysterious process they fancied to
be the various forms of disease. The mildest ailments were
thought to be caused by the spirits of those who had known
the sufferer on earth, and who accordingly were imagined to
be more merciful and more reluctant to injure an old friend
and relation. On the other hand the most malignant forms
of disease were attributed to the spirits of dead infants, who
having never learned to love their living friends, would rend
and devour the bowels of their nearest kin without compunction.
With these ideas as to the origin of disease the
Maoris naturally did not attempt to heal the sick through
the curative properties of herbs and other drugs; their
remedies consisted not in medicine but in exorcism: instead
of a physician they sent for a priest, who by his spells and
incantations undertook to drive the dangerous sprite from
the body of the patient and to appease the ancestral spirit,
whose wrath was believed to be the cause of all the mischief.
If the deity proved recalcitrant and obstinately declined to
accept this notice to quit, they did not hesitate to resort to
the most threatening and outrageous language, sometimes
telling him that they would kill and eat him, and at others
that they would burn him to a cinder if he did not take
himself off at once and allow the patient to recover.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Curiously enough, the spirit which preyed on the vitals of a
sick man was supposed to assume the form of a lizard;
hence these animals, especially a beautiful green species
which the Maoris called <i>kakariki</i>, were regarded with fear
and horror by the natives.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Once when a Maori of
Herculean thews and sinews was inadvertently shown
some green lizards preserved in a bottle of spirits, his
massive frame shrank back as from a mortal wound, and
his face betrayed signs of extreme horror. An aged chief
in the room, on learning what was the matter, cried out,
"I shall die! I shall die!" and crawled away on hands
and knees; while the other man gallantly interposed himself
as a bulwark between the fugitive and the green gods
(<i>atuas</i>) in the bottle, shifting his position adroitly so as to
screen the chief till he was out of range of the deities.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> An
old man once assured a missionary very seriously that in
attending to a sick person he had seen the god come out
of the sufferer's mouth in the form of a lizard, and that
from the same moment the patient began to mend and
was soon restored to perfect health.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 6. <i>Conclusion</i></h4>

<p>If now we attempt to sum up the effects which the
belief in human immortality exercised on the life of the
Maoris we may perhaps conclude that these effects were
partly good and partly evil. On the one hand by ascribing
to the chiefs the special protection of the powerful spirits of
the dead, it invested the governing class with a degree of
authority to which on merely natural or rational grounds
they could have laid no claim; hence it tended to strengthen
the respect for government and to ensure the maintenance of
law and order. Moreover, by lending a supernatural sanction
to the rights of private property among all classes it further
contributed to abolish one of the most fruitful sources of
discord and crime in the community and thereby to foster
economic progress, which cannot exist without some measure
of peace and security for life and possessions. These were
great gains, and so far as the faith in immortality helped to
win them for the Maoris, it certainly ameliorated their condition
and furthered the cause of civilisation among them.
But on the other hand the belief in the essential malignancy
of the spirits of the dead and in their great power to harm
the living added a host of purely imaginary terrors to the
real evils with which man's existence on earth is naturally
and inevitably encompassed: it imposed a regular system of
needless and vexatious restrictions on social intercourse and
the simplest acts of daily life; and it erected an almost
insuperable barrier to the growth of science, and particularly
of that beneficent branch of science which has for its object
the alleviation of human suffering, since by concentrating
the whole attention of the people on a false and absurd
theory of supernatural agency it diverted them from that
fruitful investigation of natural causes which alone can
strengthen and extend man's control over matter. This was
a heavy toll to pay for the advantages incidental to a belief
in immortality; and if we were asked to strike a balance
between the good and the evil which that belief entailed on
the Maoris, we might well hesitate to say to which side the
scales of judgment should incline.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Elsdon Best, "The Peopling of
New Zealand," <i>Man</i>, xiv. (1914) pp.
73-76. The Melanesian strain in the
Maoris was recognised by previous
writers. See J. S. Polack, <i>Manners
and Customs of the New Zealanders</i>
(London, 1840), i. 6, "The nation
consists of two aboriginal and distinct
races, differing, at an earlier period,
as much from each other as both are
similarly removed in similitude from
Europeans. A series of intermarriages
for centuries has not even yet obliterated
the marked difference that
originally stamped the descendant of
the now amalgamated races. The
first may be known by a dark-brown
complexion, well formed and prominent
features, erect muscular proportions,
and lank hair, with a boldness
in the gait of a warrior, wholly differing
from that of the second and inferior
race, who have a complexion
brown-black, hair inclining to the wool,
like the Eastern African, stature short,
and skin exceeding soft." The writer
rightly connects the latter people with
the stock which we now call Melanesian.
Compare also R. Taylor, <i>Te Ika A
Maui</i>, pp. 13 <i>sqq.</i>, who says (p. 13),
"The Melanesian preceded the Polynesian....
The remains of this race
are to be seen in every part of New
Zealand, especially among the Nga-ti-ka-hunu,
to which the derisive name
of Pokerekahu&mdash;Black Kumara&mdash;is
applied. The Maori traditions preserve
both the names of the canoes
which brought them to New Zealand,
as well as of the chiefs who commanded
them; several of these records
make mention of their having found
this black race in occupation of the
country on their arrival." The blending of two distinct races, a light-brown
and a dark race, among the Maoris
is clearly recognised by E. Dieffenbach,
<i>Travels in New Zealand</i>, ii.
8-11. The dark race, he says (pp. 9
<i>sq.</i>), "has undoubtedly a different
origin. This is proved by their less
regularly shaped cranium, which is
rather more compressed from the sides,
by their full and large features, prominent
cheek-bones, full lips, small
ears, curly and coarse, although not
woolly, hair, a much deeper colour of
the skin, and a short and rather ill-proportioned
figure. This race, which
is mixed in insensible gradations with
the former, is far less numerous; it
does not predominate in any one part
of the island, nor does it occupy any
particular station in a tribe, and there
is no difference made between the two
races amongst themselves; but I must
observe that I never met any man of
consequence belonging to this race,
and that, although free men, they
occupy the lower grades; from this we
may perhaps infer the relation in which
they stood to the earliest native immigrants
into the country, although their
traditions and legends are silent on the
subject."</p></div>

The elaborate system of fortification
employed by the Maoris, of which the
remains may be seen by thousands,
seems to have no exact parallel in
Polynesia. See Elsdon Best, "The
Peopling of New Zealand," <i>Man</i>, xiv.
(1914) p. 75. These native forts or
<i>pas</i>, as they were called, had often a
double or even quadruple line of fence,
the innermost formed by great poles
twenty or thirty feet high, which were
tightly woven together by the fibrous
roots of a creeper. They were built
by preference on hills, the sides of
which were scarped and terraced to
assist the defence. Some of them
were very extensive and are said to
have contained from one to two
thousand inhabitants. Many of them
were immensely strong and practically
impregnable in the absence of artillery.
It is believed that the habit of fortifying
their villages was characteristic of
the older race whom the Maoris, on
landing in New Zealand, found in
occupation of the country. See W.
Yate, <i>An Account of New Zealand</i>

make it an invariable practice,
when a child is born among them, to
take it to the <i>Tohunga</i>, or priest, who
sprinkles it on the face with water,
from a certain leaf which he holds in
his hand for that purpose; and they
believe that this ceremony is not only
beneficial to the infant, but that the
neglect of it would be attended with
the most baneful consequences. In
the latter case, they consider the child
as either doomed to immediate death,
or that, if allowed to live, it will grow
up with a most perverse and wicked
disposition." Before or after sprinkling
the child with water the priest bestowed
on the infant its name. See W. Yate,

them when the wind is high; whenever
they pass the place where a man
has been murdered, it is customary for

all those who visit a cavern at the

of departed men are supposed to pass

E. Tregear, <i>Maori-Polynesian Comparative

"karakia." Apparently the <i>karakia</i>
partook of the nature of a spell rather
than of a prayer, since it was believed
to be so potent that the mere utterance
of it compelled the gods to do the will
of the person who recited the formula.
See R. Taylor, <i>Te Ika A Maui</i>, pp.
180 <i>sq.</i>: "The Maori, in his heathen
state, never undertook any work,
whether hunting, fishing, planting, or
war, without first uttering a <i>karakia</i>;
he would not even take a journey without
repeating a spell to secure his
safety; still he could not be said to
pray, for, properly speaking, they had
no such thing as prayer. As in war,
they armed themselves with the most
formidable weapons they could procure,
and laid their plans with the greatest
skill they possessed, so to secure the
fruition of their desires, they used their
most powerful means to compel the
gods to be obedient to their wishes,
whether they sought for victory over
their foes, fruitful crops, successful
fishings, or huntings, they called in
the aid of potent incantations; when
they planted their <i>kumara</i> [sweet
potatoes], they sought to compel the
god who presided over them to yield a
good increase; when they prepared their
nets and their hooks, they must force
the ocean god to let his fish enter
them; as the kingdom of heaven
suffers violence, and the violent take
it by storm, so the heathen Maori
sought, by spells and incantations, to
compel the gods to yield to their
wishes; they added sacrifices and
offerings at the same time, to appease
as it were their anger, for being thus
constrained to do what they wished
them. Their ancestors were addressed
as powerful familiar friends; they gave
them offerings, and if it can be said
that any prayers were offered up, it
was to them they were made. The
word <i>karakia</i>, which we use for prayer,
formerly meant a spell, charm, or incantation."</p></div>

mythology Rangi is the personification
of the sky, and Papa of earth. They
were the primal parents, and the
other great gods were their offspring.
See Elsdon Best, "The Maori Genius
for Personification," <i>Transactions of the
New Zealand Institute</i>, liii. (1921) p. 2.
Among the great primordial deities
who were worshipped by all tribes of
New Zealand may be mentioned
Tane, Tu, Tangaroa, and Rongo. Of
the four, Tane was the origin and
tutelary deity of forests and birds: no
tree might be felled and no bird caught
till certain rites had been performed to
placate him. Tu was the god of war.
Tangaroa was the god of the ocean, the
origin and tutelary deity of fish. Rongo
was the god of peace, and presided
over agriculture. See Elsdon Best,
"Maori Religion," <i>Report of the
Twelfth Meeting of the Australasian
Association for the Advancement of
Science, held at Brisbane, 1909</i>, p. 458.
The same four gods, with names only
dialectically different, were, as we shall
see later on, the principal deities of the
Sandwich Islanders, the most distant
geographically from the Maoris of
all the Polynesians. The coincidence
furnishes an example of the homogeneity
of religion which prevailed
among the various branches of the
Polynesian race.</p></div>

simply by the tabooed man touching

Gudgeon, "Mana Tangata," <i>Journal

plays a leading part in the ability of a
leader, or successes in war of celebrated
warriors. When a man frequently
undertakes daring deeds, which
ought under ordinary circumstances to
fail, but none the less prove successful,
he is said to possess <i>mana</i>,
and thereafter is regarded as one
peculiarly favoured by the gods, and
in such cases it is held that he can
only be overcome by some act or
default; such as a disregard or neglect
of some religious or warlike observance,
which has been shown by experience
to be essential to success in
war, but which our warrior, spoiled
by a long career of good fortune, had
come to regard as necessary to ordinary
mortals only and of but little consequence
to men of <i>mana</i>" (W. E.
Gudgeon, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 62). "There
were cases in which the <i>mana</i> of a
man depended upon the facility with
which he could communicate with the
spirits of departed ancestors, that is,
upon his capacity to enforce the aid
and attendance of these minor deities.
To this end every man with any pretension
to <i>mana</i> had a knowledge of
certain forms of invocation by which
he could summon the spirits of long
departed heroes and ancestors, but it
must not be supposed that these invocations
would necessarily have power
in the mouths of all men, for such was
not the case. The efficacy of a <i>karakia</i>
or invocation depended in part on its
method of delivery, and in part on the
<i>mana</i> of the man who used it" (W.
E. Gudgeon, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 50). Compare

custom of the <i>tapu</i> has appeared to
some, and as many of its applications
really are, it was, notwithstanding, a
wholesome restraint, and, in many
cases, almost the only one that could
have been imposed; the heavy penalties
attached to the violation of its laws
serving in one tribe, or in several not

"Doubtless this law is the result of
some wise regulation for the protection
of property and individuals, and it has
in many things a beneficial influence
amongst a people who have no written

of their own." To the same effect
another authority on the Maoris observes:
"The most politic and useful
of all the superstitious institutions of
the Maori people is that which involves
the rites of <i>tapu</i>. It has always seemed
to me that this institution, with its far-reaching
ramifications, must have been
the conception of a very gifted mind,
for, as a governing factor, it is very
superior to the Hindu institution of
caste. It must, moreover, have been
initiated during a period of civilisation,
to which the Polynesians have long
been strangers, but with which at one
period of their history they were sufficiently
familiar." See Lieut.-Colonel

<h3>THE BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY AMONG THE TONGANS</h3>


<h4>&sect; 1. <i>The Tonga or Friendly Islands</i></h4>

<p>The Tonga or Friendly Islands form an archipelago of about
a hundred small islands situated in the South Pacific, between
18&deg; and 22&deg; South latitude and between 173&deg; and 176&deg;
East longitude. The archipelago falls into three groups of
islands, which lie roughly north and south of each other. The
southern is the Tonga group, the central is the Haabai or
Haapai group, and the northern is the Vavau group. In
the southern group the principal islands are Tongataboo and
Eua; in the central group, Namuka and Lifuka (Lefooga);
in the northern group, Vavau. The largest island of the
archipelago, Tongataboo, is about twenty-two miles long by
eight miles wide; next to it in importance are Vavau and
Eua, and there are seven or eight other islands not less than
five miles in length. The rest are mere islets. Most of the
islands are surrounded by dangerous coral reefs, and though
the soil is deep and very fertile, there is a great lack of
flowing water; running streams are almost unknown. Most
of the islands consist of coral and are very low; the highest
point of Tongataboo is only about sixty feet above the level
of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_1_128" id="FNanchor_1_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_128" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> However, some of the islands are lofty and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
volcanic formation. When Captain Cook visited the islands
in 1773 and 1777 there was apparently only one active
volcano in the archipelago; it was situated in the small
island of Tufoa, which lies to the west of Namuka. Cook
saw the island smoking at the distance of ten leagues, and
was told by the natives that it had never ceased smoking in
their memory, nor had they any tradition of its inactivity.<a name="FNanchor_2_129" id="FNanchor_2_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_129" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
In the hundred and fifty years which have elapsed since
Cook's time volcanic action has greatly increased in the archipelago.
A considerable eruption took place at Tufoa in
1885: the small but lofty island of Kao (5000 feet high)
has repeatedly been in eruption: the once fertile and populous
island of Amargura, or Funua-lai, in about 18&deg; South
latitude, was suddenly devastated in 1846 or 1847 by a
terrific eruption, which reduced it to a huge mass of lava
and burnt sand, without a leaf or blade of grass of any kind.
Warned by violent earthquakes, which preceded the explosion,
the inhabitants escaped in time to Vavau. The roar of the
volcano was heard one hundred and thirty miles off; and an
American ship sailed through a shower of ashes, rolling like great
volumes of smoke, for forty miles. For months afterwards
the glare of the tremendous fires was visible night after night
in the island of Vavau, situated forty miles away.<a name="FNanchor_3_130" id="FNanchor_3_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_130" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Another
dreadful eruption occurred on the 24th of June 1853, in
Niua Fo&ouml;u, an island about two hundred miles to the north-north-west
of Funua-lai. The entire island seems to be the
circular ridge of an ancient and vast volcano, of which the
crater is occupied by a lake of clear calm water. On the
occasion in question the earth was rent in the centre of a
native village; the flames of a new volcano burst forth from
the fissure, belching a sea of molten lava, under which ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
miles of country, once covered with the richest verdure, have
been encased in solid rock, averaging from eight to fifteen
feet in thickness. The lake boiled like a cauldron, and long
after the more powerful action of the volcano had ceased, the
waters of the lake were often rent by tongues of flame, which
shot up from them as well as from the clefts in the surrounding
precipices.<a name="FNanchor_4_131" id="FNanchor_4_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_131" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the island of Late, lying to the west of
Vavau, a new volcano broke out with great violence in 1854;
the roar of the volcano was heard at Lifuka, fifty miles
away; the immense pillar of smoke was visible by day and
the fire by night. The central portion of one side of the
mountain (about 2500 feet high) was completely blown out
by the explosion.<a name="FNanchor_5_132" id="FNanchor_5_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_132" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But not only have new volcanoes appeared or long
extinct volcanoes resumed their activity within the last
century in the existing islands, new islands have been formed
by volcanic action. One such island, emitting volumes of
fire, smoke, and steam, issued from the surface of the sea,
and was discovered by the missionary ship <i>John Wesley</i>
in August 1857; its appearance had been heralded some
years before by a strange agitation of the sea and by fire
and smoke ascending from the water. This new volcanic
island lies about midway between the two other volcanic
islands of Tufoa and Late.<a name="FNanchor_6_133" id="FNanchor_6_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_133" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A third new volcanic island
seems to have been formed to the south of Tufoa in 1886.<a name="FNanchor_7_134" id="FNanchor_7_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_134" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Another new island was thrown up from the sea about the
beginning of the twentieth century; it was partly washed
away again, but has again materially increased in size.<a name="FNanchor_8_135" id="FNanchor_8_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_135" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It
is noteworthy that the volcanoes, new or old, all occur in a
line running roughly north and south at a considerable distance
to the west of, but parallel to, the main body of the
Tongan archipelago. They clearly indicate the existence of
submarine volcanic action on a great scale. Even in the
coralline islands traces of volcanic agency have come to light
in the shape of pumice-stones, which have been dug out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the solid coral rock at considerable depths.<a name="FNanchor_9_136" id="FNanchor_9_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_136" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In the lofty
island of Eua an extensive dyke of basalt is found inland
underlying the coral formation.<a name="FNanchor_10_137" id="FNanchor_10_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_137" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>These facts lend some countenance to the view that the
whole archipelago forms the summit or visible ridge of a long
chain of submarine volcanoes, and that the islands, even
those of coralline formation, have been raised to their present
level by volcanic action.<a name="FNanchor_11_138" id="FNanchor_11_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_138" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> That very acute observer, Captain
Cook, or one of the naturalists of the expedition, noticed that
in the highest parts of Tongataboo, which he estimated roughly
at a hundred feet above sea-level, he often met with "the
same coral rock, which is found at the shore, projecting above
the surface, and perforated and cut into all those inequalities
which are usually seen in rocks that lie within the wash of
the tide."<a name="FNanchor_12_139" id="FNanchor_12_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_139" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Again, on ascending the comparatively lofty
island of Eua, Captain Cook observes: "We were now about
two or three hundred feet above the level of the sea, and yet,
even here, the coral was perforated into all the holes and
inequalities which usually diversify the surface of this substance
within the reach of the tide. Indeed, we found the
same coral till we began to approach the summits of the
highest hills; and, it was remarkable, that these were chiefly
composed of a yellowish, soft, sandy stone."<a name="FNanchor_13_140" id="FNanchor_13_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_140" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In the island
of Vavau it was remarked by Captain Waldegrave that the
coral rock rises many feet above the present level of the sea,
and he adds: "The action of fire is visible on it, and we saw
several instances of its crystallisation."<a name="FNanchor_14_141" id="FNanchor_14_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_141" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The view that even the coralline islands of the Tongan
archipelago have been elevated by volcanic agency is not
necessarily inconsistent with Darwin's theory that coral reefs
are formed during periods of subsidence, not of elevation;<a name="FNanchor_15_142" id="FNanchor_15_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_142" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
for it is quite possible that, after being raised ages ago by
volcanic forces, these islands may be now slowly subsiding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and that it has been during the period of subsidence that
they have become incrusted by coral reefs. Yet the occurrence
of coral rocks, bearing all the marks of marine action,
at considerable heights above the sea, appears indubitably to
prove that such a general subsidence has been in some places
varied by at least a temporary elevation.</p>

<p>In thus postulating elevation by volcanic action, as well
as subsidence, to explain the formation of the Tongan islands
I am glad to have the support of a good observer, the late
Rev. Dr. George Brown, who spent the best years of his life
in the Pacific, where his experience both of the larger and
the smaller islands was varied and extensive. He writes:
"I have seen islands composed of true coralline limestone,
the cliffs of which rise so perpendicularly from the blue
ocean that the natives have to ascend and descend by ladders
in going from the ocean to the top, or vice versa. A large
steamer can go so close to some of these cliffs that she
could be moored alongside of them in calm weather. It is
not at all improbable, I think, that in these islands we have
the two factors in the formation of islands, viz. subsidence,
during which these immense cliffs were formed, and subsequent
upheaval. This is the only way, I think, in which we
can account for these perpendicular cliffs in the midst of
deep blue ocean."<a name="FNanchor_16_143" id="FNanchor_16_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_143" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>I have dwelt at what may seem undue length on the
volcanic phenomena of the Tonga islands because the occurrence
of such phenomena in savage lands has generally influenced
the beliefs and customs of the natives, quite apart
from the possibility, which should always be borne in mind,
that man first obtained fire from an active volcano. But even
if, as has been suggested, the Tonga islands formed the
starting-point from which the Polynesian race spread over
the islands of the Pacific,<a name="FNanchor_17_144" id="FNanchor_17_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_144" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> it seems very unlikely that the
Polynesians first learned the use of fire when they reached the
Tongan archipelago. More probably they were acquainted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
not only with the use of fire, but with the mode of making
it long before they migrated from their original home in
Southern Asia. A people perfectly ignorant of that prime
necessity could hardly have made their way across such wide
stretches of sea and land. But it is quite possible that the
myth which the Tongans, in common with many other Polynesians,
tell of the manner in which their ancestors procured
their first fire, was suggested to them by the spectacle of a
volcano in eruption. They say that the hero Maui Kijikiji,
the Polynesian Prometheus, first procured fire for men by
descending into the bowels of the earth and stealing it from
his father, Maui Atalanga, who had kept it there jealously
concealed.<a name="FNanchor_18_145" id="FNanchor_18_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_145" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 2. <i>The Tonga Islanders, their Character, Mode of Life, and
Government</i></h4>

<p>Physically the Tonga islanders are fine specimens of the
Polynesian race and generally impress travellers very favourably.
Captain Cook, the first to observe them closely,
describes them as very strong and well made, some of them
really handsome, and many of them with truly European
features and genuine Roman noses.<a name="FNanchor_19_146" id="FNanchor_19_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_146" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> At a later date Commodore
Wilkes, the commander of the United States Exploring
Expedition, speaks of them as "some of the finest
specimens of the human race that can well be imagined,
surpassing in symmetry and grace those of all the other groups
we had visited"; and farther on he says: "A larger proportion
of fine-looking people is seldom to be seen, in any
portion of the globe; they are a shade lighter than any of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the other islanders; their countenances are generally of the
European cast; they are tall and well made, and their muscles
are well developed."<a name="FNanchor_20_147" id="FNanchor_20_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_147" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Still later, in his account of the voyage of
the <i>Challenger</i>, Lord George Campbell expressed himself even
more warmly: "There are no people in the world," he says,
"who strike one at first so much as these Friendly Islanders.
Their clear, light, copper-brown coloured skins, yellow and
curly hair, good-humoured, handsome faces, their <i>tout ensemble</i>,
formed a novel and splendid picture of the genus <i>homo</i>; and,
as far as physique and appearance go, they gave one certainly
an impression of being a superior race to ours."<a name="FNanchor_21_148" id="FNanchor_21_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_148" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> A Catholic
missionary observes that "the natives of Tonga hardly
differ from Europeans in stature, features, and colour; they
are a little sallower, which may be set down to the high
temperature of the climate. It is difficult to have a very
fresh complexion with thirty degrees of heat, R&eacute;aumur, as we
have it during four or five months of the year."<a name="FNanchor_22_149" id="FNanchor_22_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_149" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In appearance
the Tonga islanders closely resemble the Samoans, their
neighbours on the north; some find them a little lighter, but
others somewhat darker in colour than the Samoans.<a name="FNanchor_23_150" id="FNanchor_23_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_150" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> According
to the French explorer, Dumont d'Urville, who passed
about a month in Tongataboo in 1827, the Polynesian race
in Tonga exhibits less admixture with the swarthy Melanesian
race than in Tahiti and New Zealand, there being far fewer
individuals of stunted stature, flat noses, and frizzly hair
among the Tongans than among the other Polynesians.<a name="FNanchor_24_151" id="FNanchor_24_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_151" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Even among the Tongans the physical superiority of the
chiefs to the common people is said to be conspicuous; they
are taller, comelier, and lighter in colour than the lower
orders. Some would explain the difference by a difference
in upbringing, noblemen being more carefully nursed, better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
fed, and less exposed to the sun than commoners;<a name="FNanchor_25_152" id="FNanchor_25_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_152" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> but it is
possible that they come of a different and better stock.</p>

<p>Intellectually the Tongans are reported to "surpass all
the other South Sea islanders in their mental development,
showing great skill in the structure of their dwellings and
the manufacture of their implements, weapons, and dress."<a name="FNanchor_26_153" id="FNanchor_26_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_153" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
They are bold navigators,<a name="FNanchor_27_154" id="FNanchor_27_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_154" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and Captain Cook observes that
"nothing can be a more demonstrative evidence of their
ingenuity than the construction and make of their canoes,
which, in point of neatness and workmanship, exceed everything
of this kind we saw in this sea."<a name="FNanchor_28_155" id="FNanchor_28_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_155" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> However, the
Tongans appear to have acquired much of their skill in the
art of building and rigging canoes through intercourse with
the Fijians, their neighbours to the west, who, though their
inferiors in seamanship and the spirit of marine adventure,
originally surpassed them in naval architecture.<a name="FNanchor_29_156" id="FNanchor_29_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_156" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Indeed we
are told that all the large Tongan canoes are built in Fiji,
because the Tongan islands do not furnish any timber fit for
the purpose. Hence a number of Tongans are constantly
employed in the windward or eastern islands of the Fiji
group building these large canoes, a hundred feet or more in
length, a process which, it is said, lasts six or seven years.<a name="FNanchor_30_157" id="FNanchor_30_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_157" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The debt which in this respect the Tongans owe to the
Fijians was necessarily unknown to Captain Cook, since he
never reached the Fijian islands and knew of them only by
report, though he met and questioned a few Fijians in
Tongataboo.<a name="FNanchor_31_158" id="FNanchor_31_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_158" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>When Captain Cook visited the Tonga islands he found
the land almost everywhere in a high state of cultivation.
He says that "cultivated roots and fruits being their
principal support, this requires their constant attention to
agriculture, which they pursue very diligently, and seem
to have brought almost to as great perfection as circumstances
will permit."<a name="FNanchor_32_159" id="FNanchor_32_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_159" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The plants which they chiefly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
cultivated and which furnished them with their staple foods
were yams and plantains. These were disposed in plantations
enclosed by neat fences of reeds about six feet high
and intersected by good smooth roads or lanes, which were
shaded from the scorching sun by fruit-trees.<a name="FNanchor_33_160" id="FNanchor_33_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_160" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Walking
on one of these roads Cook tells us, "I thought I was
transported into the most fertile plains in Europe. There
was not an inch of waste ground; the roads occupied no
more space than was absolutely necessary; the fences did
not take up above four inches each; and even this was not
wholly lost, for in many places were planted some useful
trees or plants. It was everywhere the same; change of
place altered not the scene. Nature, assisted by a little
art, nowhere appears in more splendour than at this isle."<a name="FNanchor_34_161" id="FNanchor_34_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_161" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Interspersed among these plantations irregularly were bread-fruit
trees and coco-nut palms, of which the palms in
particular, raising their tufted heads in air above the sea
of perpetual verdure, formed a pleasing ornament of the
landscape.<a name="FNanchor_35_162" id="FNanchor_35_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_162" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> There were no towns or villages; most of the
houses were built in the plantations, generally surrounded
by trees or ornamental shrubs, whose fragrancy perfumed
the air.<a name="FNanchor_36_163" id="FNanchor_36_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_163" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>When Captain Cook surveyed this rich and beautiful
country, the islands were and had long been at peace, so
that the natives were able to devote themselves without
distraction to the labour of tilling the soil and providing
in other ways for the necessities of life. Unhappily shortly
after his visit to the islands wars broke out among the
inhabitants and continued to rage more or less intermittently
for many years. Even the introduction of Christianity in
the early part of the nineteenth century, far from assuaging
the strife, only added bitterness to it by furnishing a fresh
pretext for hostilities, in which apparently the Christians
were sometimes the aggressors with the connivance or even
the encouragement of the missionaries.<a name="FNanchor_37_164" id="FNanchor_37_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_164" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> In consequence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
cultivation was neglected and large portions of land were
allowed to lie waste.<a name="FNanchor_38_165" id="FNanchor_38_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_165" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Like all the Polynesians the natives of Tonga were
ignorant of the metals, and their only tools were made of
stone, bone, shells, shark's teeth, and rough fish-skins. They
fashioned axes, or rather adzes, out of a smooth black stone,
which they procured from the volcanic island of Tufoa;
they used shells as knives; they constructed augers out of
shark's teeth, fixed on handles; and they made rasps of the
rough skin of a fish, fastened on flat pieces of wood. With
such imperfect tools they built their canoes and houses,
reared the massive tombs of their kings; and did all their
other work.<a name="FNanchor_39_166" id="FNanchor_39_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_166" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The wonder is that with implements so
imperfect they could accomplish so much and raise themselves
to a comparatively high level among savages.</p>

<p>A feature of the Tongan character in which the islanders
evinced their superiority to most of the Polynesians was
their regard for women. In most savage tribes which
practise agriculture the labour of tilling the fields falls in
great measure on the female sex, but it was not so in Tonga.
There the women never tilled the ground nor did any hard
work, though they occupied themselves with the manufacture
of bark-cloth, mats, and other articles of domestic use.
Natives of Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii, who resided in Tonga,
used to remark on the easy lives led by the Tongan women,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and remonstrated with the men on the subject, saying that
as men underwent hardships and dangers in war and other
masculine pursuits, so women ought to be made to labour
in the fields and to toil for their living. But the Tongan
men said that "it is not <i>gnale faf&iacute;ne</i> (consistent with the
feminine character) to let them do hard work; women
ought only to do what is feminine: who loves a masculine
woman? besides, men are stronger, and therefore it is but
proper that they should do the hard labour."<a name="FNanchor_40_167" id="FNanchor_40_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_167" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Further, it is to the credit of the Tongans that, unlike
many other Polynesians, they were not generally cannibals,
and indeed for the most part held in abhorrence the practice
of eating human bodies. Still young warriors occasionally
devoured the corpses of their enemies in imitation of the
Fijians, imagining that in so doing they manifested a fierce,
warlike, and manly spirit. On one occasion, returning from
such a repast, they were shunned by every one, especially by
the women, who upbraided them, saying, "Away! you are
a man-eater."<a name="FNanchor_41_168" id="FNanchor_41_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_168" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The government of the Tongan islanders was eminently
monarchical and aristocratic. A strict subordination of
ranks was established which has been aptly compared to
the feudal system. At the head of the social edifice were
two chiefs who bore some resemblance to the Emperor
and the Pope of mediaeval Europe, the one being the civil
and military head of the State, while the other embodied
the supreme spiritual power. Nominally the spiritual chief,
called the Tooitonga, ranked above the civil chief or king,
who paid him formal homage; but, as usually happens in
such cases, the real government was in the hands of the
secular rather than of the religious monarch. The Tooitonga
was acknowledged to be descended from one of the chief
gods; he is spoken of by Mariner, our principal authority,
as a divine chief of the highest rank, and he is said to have
enjoyed divine honours. The first-fruits of the year were
offered to him, and it was supposed that if this ceremony
were neglected, the vengeance of the gods would fall in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
signal manner upon the people. Yet he had no power or
authority in matters pertaining to the civil king.<a name="FNanchor_42_169" id="FNanchor_42_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_169" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The
existence of such a double kingship, with a corresponding
distribution of temporal and spiritual functions, is not
uncommon in more advanced societies; its occurrence
among a people so comparatively low in the scale of culture
as the Tongans is remarkable.</p>

<p>Below the two great chiefs or kings were many subordinate
chiefs, and below them again the social ranks
descended in a succession of sharply marked gradations to
the peasants, who tilled the ground, and whose lives and
property were entirely at the mercy of the chiefs.<a name="FNanchor_43_170" id="FNanchor_43_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_170" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Yet the
social system as a whole seems to have worked well and
smoothly. "It does not, indeed, appear," says Captain
Cook, "that any of the most civilised nations have ever
exceeded this people, in the great order observed on all
occasions; in ready compliance with the commands of their
chiefs; and in the harmony that subsists throughout all
ranks, and unites them, as if they were all one man, informed
with, and directed by, the same principle."<a name="FNanchor_44_171" id="FNanchor_44_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_171" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> According to
the American ethnographer, Horatio Hale, the mass of the
people in the Tonga islands had no political rights, and
their condition in that respect was much inferior to that of
commoners in the Samoan islands, since in Tonga the
government was much stronger and better organized, as he
puts it, for the purpose of oppression. On the other hand,
he admitted that government in Tonga was milder than in
Tahiti, and infinitely preferable to the debasing despotism
which prevailed in Hawaii or the Sandwich Islands.<a name="FNanchor_45_172" id="FNanchor_45_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_172" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<h4>&sect; 3. <i>The Tongan Religion: its General Principles</i></h4>

<p>For our knowledge of the religion and the social condition
of the Tongans before they came under European
influence, we are indebted chiefly to an English sailor,
William Mariner, who lived as a captive among them for
about four years, from 1806 to 1810.<a name="FNanchor_46_173" id="FNanchor_46_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_173" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> His account of the
natives, carefully elicited from him and published by a
medical doctor, Mr. John Martin, M.D., is one of the most
valuable descriptions of a savage people which we possess.
Mariner was a good observer and endowed with an excellent
memory, which enabled him to retain and record his experiences
after his return to England. He spoke the
Tongan language, and he was a special favourite of the two
Tongan kings, named Finow, who reigned successively in
Tonga during his residence in the islands. The kings befriended
and protected him, so that he had the best opportunities
for becoming acquainted with the customs and
beliefs of the people. His observations have been confirmed
from independent sources, and we have every reason
to regard them as trustworthy. So far as we can judge,
they are a simple record of facts, unbiassed by theory or
prejudice. In the following notice of the Tongan religion
and doctrine of the human soul I shall draw chiefly on the
evidence of Mariner.</p>

<p>According to him, the religion of the Tonga islanders
rests, or rather used to rest, on the following notions.<a name="FNanchor_47_174" id="FNanchor_47_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_174" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>They believed that there are <i>hotooas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_48_175" id="FNanchor_48_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_175" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> gods, or superior
beings, who have the power of dispensing good and evil to
mankind, according to their merit, but of whose origin the
Tongans formed no idea, rather supposing them to be
eternal.</p>

<p>They believed that there are other <i>hotooas</i> or gods, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
are the souls of all deceased nobles and <i>matabooles</i>, that is,
the companions, ministers, and counsellors of the chiefs, who
form a sort of inferior nobility.<a name="FNanchor_49_176" id="FNanchor_49_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_176" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The souls of all these
dead men were held to possess a power of dispensing good
and evil to mankind like the power of the superior gods,
but in a lesser degree.</p>

<p>They believed that there are besides several <i>hotooa pow</i>,
or mischievous gods, who never dispense good, but only
petty evils and troubles, not as a punishment, but indiscriminately
to anybody, from a purely mischievous disposition.</p>

<p>They believed that all these superior beings, although
they may perhaps have had a beginning, will have no end.</p>

<p>They believed that the world also is of uncertain origin,
having coexisted with the gods. The sky, which they
regard as solid, the heavenly bodies, and the ocean were in
being before the habitable earth. The Tonga islands were
drawn up out of the depth of the sea by the god Tangaloa
one day when he was fishing with a line and a hook.</p>

<p>They believed that mankind, according to a partial
tradition, came originally from Bolotoo, the chief residence
of the gods, a fabulous island situated to the north-west of
the Tongan archipelago. The first men and women consisted
of two brothers, with their wives and attendants.
They were commanded by the god Tangaloa to take up
their abode in the Tonga islands, but of their origin or
creation the Tongans professed to know nothing.<a name="FNanchor_50_177" id="FNanchor_50_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_177" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>They believed that all human evil was inflicted by the
gods upon mankind on account of some neglect of religious
duty, whether the neglect is the fault of the sufferers or of
the chief whom they serve. In like manner the Tongans
apparently referred all human good to the gods, regarding
it as a reward bestowed by the divine beings on men who
punctually discharged the offices of religion.<a name="FNanchor_51_178" id="FNanchor_51_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_178" class="fnanchor">[51]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>They believed that nobles had souls, which existed after
death in Bolotoo, not according to their moral merit, but
according to their rank in this world; these had power like
that of the original gods, but less in degree. The <i>matabooles</i>,
or ministers of the nobles, also went after death to Bolotoo,
where they existed as <i>matabooles</i>, or ministers of the gods,
but they had not, like the gods and the souls of dead noblemen,
the power of inspiring the priests with superhuman
knowledge. Some thought that the <i>mooas</i>, who ranked
next below the <i>matabooles</i> in the social hierarchy, also went
after death to Bolotoo; but this was a matter of great
doubt. As for the <i>tooas</i> or commoners, who formed the
lowest rung in the social ladder, they had either no souls at
all or only such as dissolved with the body after death,
which consequently ended their sentient existence.</p>

<p>They believed that the human soul during life is not an
essence distinct from the body, but only the more ethereal
part of the corporeal frame, and that the moment after
death it exists in Bolotoo with the form and likeness of the
body which it had on earth.</p>

<p>They believed that the primitive gods and deceased
nobles sometimes appear visibly to mankind to warn or to
afford comfort and advice; and that the primitive gods also
sometimes come into the living bodies of lizards, porpoises,
and a species of water snake, hence these animals are much
respected. When the gods thus entered into the bodies of
porpoises, it was for the sake of safeguarding canoes or for
other beneficent purposes.</p>

<p>They believed that the two personages in the Tonga
islands known by the titles of Tooitonga and Veachi were
descendants in a right line from two chief gods, and that all
respect and veneration are therefore due to them.</p>

<p>They believed that some persons are favoured with the
inspiration of the gods, and that while the inspiration lasts
the god actually exists in the body of the inspired person or
priest, who is then capable of prophesying.</p>

<p>They believe that human merit or virtue consists chiefly
in paying respect to the gods, nobles, and aged persons; in
defending one's hereditary rights; in honour, justice,
patriotism, friendship, meekness, modesty, fidelity of married<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
women, parental and filial love, observance of all religious
ceremonies, patience in suffering, forbearance of temper, and
so on.</p>

<p>They believed that all rewards for virtue or punishments
for vice happen to men in this world only, and come immediately
from the gods.</p>

<p>They believed that several acts which civilised nations
regard as crimes are, under certain circumstances, matters
of indifference. Such acts included the taking of revenge
on an enemy and the killing of a servant who had
given provocation, or indeed the killing of anybody else,
always provided that the victim were not a very superior
chief or noble. Further, among indifferent acts was reckoned
rape, unless it were committed on a married woman or on
one whom the offender was bound to respect on the score of
her superior rank. Finally, the list of venial offences included
theft, unless the stolen object were consecrated property;
for in that case the action became sacrilege and was, as we
shall see presently, a very serious crime.</p>

<p>They believed that omens are the direct intimations of
the future vouchsafed by the gods to men. "Charms or
superstitious ceremonies to bring evil upon any one are
considered for the most part infallible, as being generally
effective means to dispose the gods to accord with the curse
or evil wish of the malevolent invoker; to perform these
charms is considered cowardly and unmanly, but does not
constitute a crime."<a name="FNanchor_52_179" id="FNanchor_52_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_179" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> One such charm consisted in hiding
on a grave (<i>fytoca</i>) some portion of the wearing apparel of
an inferior relation of the deceased. The person whose
garment was so hidden was believed to sicken and die.
An equally effectual way of working the charm and ensuring
the death of the victim was to bury the garment in the
house consecrated to the tutelary god of the family. But
when a grave was made use of for the malignant purpose,
it was thought essential that the deceased should be of a
rank superior to that of the person against whom the charm
was directed; otherwise it was supposed that the charm
would have no effect.<a name="FNanchor_53_180" id="FNanchor_53_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_180" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In either case the fatal result was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
clearly held to be brought about by the power of the ghost
or of the god, who used the garment as an instrument for
putting the charm in operation. These charms or superstitious
ceremonies are what we should now call magical
rites, and they were apparently supposed to effect their
purpose indirectly by constraining the gods to carry out the
malevolent intention of the magician. If I am right in so
interpreting them, we seem driven to conclude that in
Tonga magic was supposed to be ineffectual without the
co-operation of the gods, although its power to compel them
was deemed for the most part irresistible. Even so its
assumed dependence on the consent, albeit the reluctant
consent, of the deities implies a certain decadence of magic
and a growing predominance of religion. Moreover, the
moral reprehension of such practices for the injury of
enemies is another sign that among the Tongans magic was
being relegated to that position of a black art which it
generally occupies among more civilised peoples. Be that
as it may, certain it is that we hear extremely little about
the practice of magic among the Tongans.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4. <i>The Primary or Non-human Gods</i></h4>

<p>Such are, or rather used to be, the principal articles of
the old Tongan creed. We may now examine some of
them a little more at large. But first we may observe that
on this showing the Tongans were an eminently religious
people. They traced all the good and ill in human affairs
to the direct intervention of the gods, who rewarded or
punished mankind for their deeds in this life, bestowing the
reward or inflicting the punishment in the present world
and not deferring either to a distant and more or less
uncertain future in a world beyond the grave. Thus with
the Tongans the fear of the gods was a powerful incentive
to lead a virtuous life; morality was placed under the
immediate guardianship of the deities. It is true that
according to their notions morality consisted largely in the
performance of religious ceremonies, but it was by no means
limited to a simple observance of the prescribed rites; for
we have seen that their conception of a virtuous life included<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
compliance with the dictates of justice, modesty, and friendship,
the fidelity of wives to their husbands, the mutual
affection of parents and children, patience in suffering, and
other modes of conduct which we too should not hesitate to
rank among the virtues.</p>

<p>When we consider the nature of the Tongan gods, we
perceive that they are sharply discriminated into two classes,
namely, the primitive and superior gods on the one side and
the secondary and inferior gods on the other side. The
primitive and superior gods are those who have always been
gods and whose origin and beginning are unknown; the
secondary and inferior gods are the souls of dead men, who
consequently have not always been gods, because they were
human beings before death elevated them to the rank of
deities. The distinction between these two classes of gods
is highly important, not merely for Tongan religion in
particular, but for the history of religion in general. For
whatever we may think of Euhemerism as a universal
explanation of the gods, there can be no doubt that in many
lands the ranks of the celestial hierarchy have been largely
recruited by the ghosts of men of flesh and blood. But
there appears to be a general tendency to allow the origin
of the human gods to fall into the background and to
confuse them with the true original deities, who from the
beginning have always been deities and nothing else. The
tendency may sometimes be accentuated by a deliberate
desire to cast a veil over the humble birth and modest
beginning of these now worshipful beings; but probably the
obliteration of the distinction between the two classes of
divinities is usually a simple result of oblivion and the lapse
of time. Once a man is dead, his figure, which bulked so
large and so clear to his contemporaries, begins to fade and
melt away into something vague and indistinct, until, if he
was a person of no importance, he is totally forgotten; or,
if he was one whose actions or thoughts deeply influenced
his fellows for good or evil, his memory lingers in after
generations, growing ever dimmer and it may be looming
ever larger through the long vista of the ages, as the
evening mist appears to magnify the orb of the descending
sun. Thus naturally and insensibly, as time goes on,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
our mortal nature fades or brightens into the immortal and
divine.</p>

<p>As our subject is the belief in immortality and the
worship of the dead, we are not directly concerned with the
original Tongan deities who were believed never to have
been men. But since their functions and worship appear to
have been in certain respects closely analogous to those of
the inferior deities, the souls of the dead, some notice of
them may not be out of place, if it helps to a fuller understanding
of what we may call the human gods. Besides,
we must always bear in mind that some at least of the so-called
original gods may have been men, whose history and
humanity had been forgotten. We can hardly doubt that
the celestial hierarchy has often been recruited by the souls
of the dead.</p>

<p>The original and superior gods, Mariner tells us, were
thought to be rather numerous, perhaps about three hundred
all told; but the names of very few of them were known,
and even those few were familiar only to some of the chiefs
and their ministers, the <i>matabooles</i>; "for it may easily be
supposed," says Mariner, "that, where no written records
are kept, only those (gods) whose attributes particularly
concern the affairs of this world should be much talked of;
as to the rest, they are, for the most part, merely tutelar
gods to particular private families, and having nothing in
their history at all interesting, are scarcely known to
anybody else."<a name="FNanchor_54_181" id="FNanchor_54_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_181" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Among these original and superior deities was Tali-y-Toobo,
the patron god of the civil king and his family.
He was the god of war and was consequently always invoked
in time of war by the king's family; in time of
peace prayers were sometimes offered to him for the general
good of the nation as well as for the particular interest and
welfare of the royal house. He had no priest, unless it was
the king himself, who was occasionally inspired by him;
but sometimes a whole reign would pass without the king
being once favoured with the divine afflatus.<a name="FNanchor_55_182" id="FNanchor_55_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_182" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Another god was Tooi fooa Bolotoo, whose name means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
"Chief of all Bolotoo." From this it might be supposed
that he was the greatest god in Bolotoo, the home of the
gods and of the deified spirits of men; but in fact he was
regarded as inferior to the war god, and the natives could
give no explanation of his high-sounding title. He was the
god of rank in society, and as such he was often invoked
by the heads of great families on occasion of sickness or
other trouble. He had several priests, whom he occasionally
inspired.<a name="FNanchor_56_183" id="FNanchor_56_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_183" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Another great god was Toobo Toty, whose name
signifies "Toobo the mariner." He was the god of voyages,
and in that capacity was invoked by chiefs or anybody else
at sea; for his principal function was to preserve canoes
from accidents. Without being himself the god of wind,
he had great influence with that deity, and was thus enabled
no doubt to save many who were in peril on the great
deep.<a name="FNanchor_57_184" id="FNanchor_57_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_184" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Another god was Alo Alo, whose name means "to fan."
He was the god of wind and weather, rain, harvest, and
vegetation in general. When the weather was seasonable,
he was usually invoked about once a month to induce him
to keep on his good behaviour; but when the weather was
unseasonable, or the islands were swept by destructive
storms of wind and rain, the prayers to him were repeated
daily. But he was not supposed to wield the thunder and
lightning, "of which, indeed," says Mariner, "there is no god
acknowledged among them, as this phenomenon is never
recollected to have done any mischief of consequence."<a name="FNanchor_58_185" id="FNanchor_58_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_185" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
From this it would appear that where no harm was done,
the Tongans found it needless to suppose the existence of
a deity; they discovered the hand of a god only in the
working of evil; fear was the mainspring of their religion.
In boisterous weather at sea Alo Alo was not invoked; he
had then to make room for the superior god, Toobo Toty,
the protector of canoes, who with other sea gods always
received the homage of storm-tossed mariners. However,
Alo Alo, the weather god, came to his own when the yams
were approaching maturity in the early part of November.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
For then offerings of yams, coco-nuts, and other vegetable
products were offered to him in particular, as well as to all
the other gods in general, for the purpose of ensuring a
continuation of favourable weather and consequent fertility.
The offering was accompanied by prayers to Alo Alo and
the other gods, beseeching them to extend their bounty
and make the land fruitful. Wrestling and boxing matches
formed part of the ceremony, which was repeated eight
times at intervals of ten days. The time for the rite was
fixed by the priest of Alo Alo, and a curious feature of the
ceremony was the presence of a girl of noble family, some
seven or eight years old, who represented the wife of Alo
Alo and resided in his consecrated house during the eighty
days that the festal season lasted.<a name="FNanchor_59_186" id="FNanchor_59_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_186" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Another god named M&oacute;ooi was believed to support the
earth on his prostrate body. In person he was bigger than
any other of the gods; but he never inspired anybody, and
had no house dedicated to his service. Indeed, it was
supposed that this Atlas of the Pacific never budged from his
painful and burdensome post beneath the earth. Only
when he felt more than usually uneasy, he tried to turn
himself about under his heavy load; and the movement was
felt as an earthquake by the Tongans, who endeavoured to
make him lie still by shouting and beating the ground with
sticks.<a name="FNanchor_60_187" id="FNanchor_60_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_187" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Similar attempts to stop an earthquake are common
in many parts of the world.<a name="FNanchor_61_188" id="FNanchor_61_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_188" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Tangaloa was the god of artificers and the arts. He
had several priests, who in Mariner's time were all carpenters.
It was he who was said to have brought up the Tonga
islands from the bottom of the sea at the end of his fishing
line;<a name="FNanchor_62_189" id="FNanchor_62_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_189" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> though in some accounts of Tongan tradition this feat
is attributed to Maui.<a name="FNanchor_63_190" id="FNanchor_63_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_190" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The very hook on which he hauled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
up the islands was said to be preserved in Tonga down to
about thirty years before Mariner's time. It was in the
possession of the divine chief Tooitonga; but unfortunately,
his house catching fire, the basket in which the precious
hook was kept perished with its contents in the flames.
When Mariner asked Tooitonga what sort of hook it was,
the chief told him that it was made of tortoise-shell,
strengthened with a piece of whalebone, and that it measured
six or seven inches from the curve to the point where the
line was attached, and an inch and a half between the barb
and the stem. Mariner objected that such a hook could
hardly have been strong enough to support the whole weight
of the Tonga islands; but the chief replied that it was a
god's hook and therefore could not break. The hole in
the rock in which the divine hook caught on the memorable
occasion was shown down to Mariner's time in the island of
Hoonga. It was an aperture about two feet square.<a name="FNanchor_64_191" id="FNanchor_64_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_191" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 5. <i>The Temples of the Gods</i></h4>

<p>Some of the primitive gods had houses dedicated to
them. These sacred houses or temples, as we may call
them, were built in the style of ordinary dwellings; but
generally more than ordinary care was taken both in constructing
them and in keeping them in good order, decorating
their enclosures with flowers, and so on. About twenty of
the gods had houses thus consecrated to them; some of
them had five or six houses, some only one or two. For
example, Tali-y-Toobo, the patron god of the royal family,
had four houses dedicated to him in the island of Vavau,
two in the island of Lefooga (Lifuka), and two or three
others of smaller importance elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_65_192" id="FNanchor_65_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_192" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Another patron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
god of the royal family, called Alai Valoo, had a large
consecrated enclosure in the island of Ofoo; he had also at
least one priest and was very frequently consulted in behalf
of sick persons.<a name="FNanchor_66_193" id="FNanchor_66_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_193" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>To desecrate any of these holy houses or enclosures
was a most serious offence. When Mariner was in the
islands it happened that two boys, who had belonged to
the crew of his ship, were detected in the act of stealing a
bale of bark-cloth from a consecrated house. If they had
been natives, they would instantly have been punished with
death; but the chiefs, taking into consideration the youth
and inexperience of the offenders, who were foreigners and
ignorant of native customs, decided that for that time the
crime might be overlooked. Nevertheless, to appease the
anger of the god, to whom the house was consecrated, it
was deemed necessary to address him humbly on the subject.
Accordingly his priest, followed by chiefs and their ministers
(<i>matabooles</i>), all dressed in mats with leaves of the <i>ifi</i> tree<a name="FNanchor_67_194" id="FNanchor_67_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_194" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
round their necks in token of humility and sorrow, went in
solemn procession to the house; they sat down before it, and
the priest addressed the divinity to the following purport:
"Here you see the chiefs and <i>matabooles</i> that have come to
thee, hoping that thou wilt be merciful: the boys are young,
and being foreigners, are not so well acquainted with our
customs, and did not reflect upon the greatness of the
crime: we pray thee, therefore, not to punish the people
for the sins of these thoughtless youths: we have spared
them, and hope that thou wilt be merciful and spare us."
The priest then rose up, and they all retired in the same way
they had come. The chiefs, and particularly the king,
severely reprimanded the boys, endeavouring to impress on
their minds the enormity of their offence, and assuring them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
that they owed their lives only to their presumed ignorance
of the heinousness of the crime.<a name="FNanchor_68_195" id="FNanchor_68_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_195" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Another case of sacrilege, which occurred in Mariner's
time, was attended with more tragic consequences. He tells
us that consecrated places might not be the scene of war,
and that it would be highly sacrilegious to attack an enemy
or to spill his blood within their confines. On one occasion,
while Mariner was in the islands, four men, pursued by their
enemies, fled for refuge to a consecrated enclosure, where
they would have been perfectly safe. One of them was in
the act of scrambling over the reed fence, and had got a
leg over it, when he was overtaken by a foe, who struck
him such a furious blow on the head that he fell dead within
the hallowed ground. Conscience-stricken, the slayer fled to
his canoe, followed by his men; and on arriving at the
fortress where the king was stationed he made a clean
breast of his crime, alleging in excuse that it had been committed
in hot blood when he had lost all self-command.
The king immediately ordered kava to be taken to the priest
of his own tutelary god, that the divinity might be consulted
as to what atonement was proper to be made for so heinous a
sacrilege. Under the double inspiration of kava and the deity,
the priest made answer that it was necessary a child should be
strangled to appease the anger of the gods. The chiefs then
held a consultation and determined to sacrifice the child of
a high chief named Toobo Toa. The child was about two
years old and had been born to him by a female attendant.
On such occasions the child of a male chief by a female
attendant was always chosen for the victim first, because, as
a child of a chief, he was a worthier victim, and second,
because, as a child of a female attendant, he was not himself
a chief; for nobility being traced in the female line only
those children were reckoned chiefs whose mothers were
chieftainesses; the rank of the father, whether noble or not,
did not affect the rank of his offspring. On this occasion
the father of the child was present at the consultation and
consented to the sacrifice. The mother, fearing the decision,
had concealed the child, but it was found by one of the
searchers, who took it up in his arms, while it smiled with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
delight at being noticed. The mother tried to follow but
was held back; and on hearing her voice the child began
to cry. But on reaching the place of execution it was
pleased and delighted with the bandage that was put round
its neck to strangle it, and looking up in the face of the
executioner it smiled again. "Such a sight," we are told,
"inspired pity in the breast of every one: but veneration and
fear of the gods was a sentiment superior to every other,
and its destroyer could not help exclaiming, as he put on
the fatal bandage, <i>O iaao&eacute; chi vale!</i> (poor little innocent!)."
Two men then tightened the cord by pulling at each end,
and the struggles of the innocent victim were soon over.
The little body was next placed upon a sort of hand-barrow,
supported on the shoulders of four men, and carried in a
procession of priests, chiefs, and <i>matabooles</i>, all clothed as
suppliants in mats and with wreaths of green leaves round
their necks. In this way it was conveyed to various houses
dedicated to different gods, before each of which it was
placed on the ground, all the company sitting behind it,
except one priest, who sat beside it and prayed aloud to the
god that he would be pleased to accept of this sacrifice as
an atonement for the heinous sacrilege committed, and that
punishment might accordingly be withheld from the people.
When this had been done before all the consecrated houses
in the fortress, the body was given up to its relations, to be
buried in the usual manner.<a name="FNanchor_69_196" id="FNanchor_69_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_196" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The consecration of a house or a piece of ground to a
god was denoted by the native word <i>taboo</i>, the general meaning
of which was prohibited or forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_70_197" id="FNanchor_70_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_197" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> It was firmly
believed by the Tongans in former days that if a man committed
sacrilege or broke a taboo, his liver or some other
of his internal organs was liable to become enlarged and
scirrhous, that is, indurated or knotty; hence they often
opened dead bodies out of curiosity, to see whether the
deceased had been sacrilegious in their lifetime. As the
Tongans are particularly subject to scirrhous tumours, it seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
probable that many innocent persons were thus posthumously
accused of sacrilege on the strength of a post-mortem examination
into the state of their livers.<a name="FNanchor_71_198" id="FNanchor_71_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_198" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Another disagreeable
consequence of breaking a taboo was a peculiar liability
to be bitten by sharks, which thus might be said to act
as ministers of justice. As theft was included under the
general head of breach of taboo, a simple way of bringing
the crime home to the thief in case of doubt was to cause
the accused to go into the water where sharks were known
to swarm; if they bit him, he was guilty; if they did not,
he was innocent.<a name="FNanchor_72_199" id="FNanchor_72_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_199" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 6. <i>Priests and their Inspiration</i></h4>

<p>Priests were known by the title of <i>fahe-gehe</i>, a term
which means "split off," "separate," or "distinct from," and
was applied to a man who has a peculiar sort of mind or
soul, different from that of ordinary men, which disposed
some god occasionally to inspire him. Such inspirations
frequently happened, and when the fit was on him the
priest had the same reverence shown to him as if he
were the god himself; at these times even the king would
retire to a respectful distance and sit down among the rest
of the spectators, because a god was believed to exist at
that moment in the priest and to speak from his mouth.
But at other times a priest had no other respect paid to him
than was due to him for his private rank in society. Priests
generally belonged to the lower order of chiefs or to their
ministers, the <i>matabooles</i>; but sometimes great chiefs were
thus visited by the gods, and the king himself has been
inspired by Tali-y-Toobo, the chief of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_73_200" id="FNanchor_73_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_200" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The profession
of priest was generally hereditary, the eldest son
of a priest becoming, on his father's death, a priest of the
same god who had inspired his deceased parent. In their uninspired
moments the priests lived indiscriminately with the
rest of the people and were treated with no special deference.<a name="FNanchor_74_201" id="FNanchor_74_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_201" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The ceremony of inspiration, during which the priest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
was believed to be possessed by a god and to speak in his
name, was regularly accompanied or preceded by a feast,
at which the drinking of kava formed the principal feature.
The priest himself presided at the feast and the people
gathered in a circle round him; or, to be more exact, the
people formed an ellipse, of which the priest occupied the
place of honour at one of the narrow ends; while opposite
him, at the other extremity of the ellipse, sat the man who
was charged with the important duty of brewing the kava.
At such sessions the chiefs sat indiscriminately among the
people on account of the sacredness of the occasion, conceiving
that such humble demeanour must be acceptable to
the gods. The actual process of inspiration was often witnessed
by Mariner, and is described by him in his own
words as follows:</p>

<p>"As soon as they are all seated, the priest is considered
as inspired, the god being supposed to exist within him from
that moment. He remains for a considerable time in silence,
with his hands clasped before him; his eyes are cast down,
and he rests perfectly still. During the time that the victuals
are being shared out, and the cava preparing, the <i>matabooles</i>
sometimes begin to consult him; sometimes he answers
them, at other times not; in either case he remains with his
eyes cast down. Frequently he will not utter a word till
the repast is finished, and the cava too. When he speaks,
he generally begins in a low and very altered tone of voice,
which gradually rises to nearly its natural pitch, though
sometimes a little above it. All that he says is supposed
to be the declaration of the god, and he accordingly speaks
in the first person as if he were the god. All this is done
generally without any apparent inward emotion or outward
agitation; but on some occasions his countenance becomes
fierce, and, as it were, inflamed, and his whole frame agitated
with inward feeling; he is seized with an universal trembling;
the perspiration breaks out on his forehead, and his lips,
turning black, are convulsed; at length, tears start in floods
from his eyes, his breast heaves with great emotion, and his
utterance is choked. These symptoms gradually subside.
Before this paroxysm comes on, and after it is over, he often
eats as much as four hungry men, under other circumstances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
could devour. The fit being now gone off, he
remains for some time calm, and then takes up a club that
is placed by him for the purpose, turns it over and regards
it attentively; he then looks up earnestly, now to the right,
now to the left, and now again at the club; afterwards he
looks up again, and about him in like manner, and then again
fixes his eyes upon his club, and so on, for several times:
at length he suddenly raises the club, and, after a moment's
pause, strikes the ground, or the adjacent part of the house,
with considerable force: immediately the god leaves him,
and he rises up and retires to the back of the ring among
the people."<a name="FNanchor_75_202" id="FNanchor_75_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_202" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 7. <i>The Worship of the Gods, Prayers, and Sacrifices</i></h4>

<p>The worship offered to the gods consisted as usual of
prayers and sacrifices. Prayers were put up to them, sometimes
in the fields, and sometimes at their consecrated
houses. On ordinary occasions a simple offering consisted
of a small piece of kava root deposited before a god's house.<a name="FNanchor_76_203" id="FNanchor_76_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_203" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
But in the great emergencies of life the favour of the gods
was sued with more precious offerings. When the younger
daughter of Finow, a girl of six or seven years, was sick to
death, the dying princess was carried from her father's house
into the sacred enclosure of Tali-y-Toobo, the patron god
of the kings, and there she remained for a fortnight. Almost
every morning a hog was killed, dressed, and presented
before the god's house to induce him to spare the life of the
princess. At the same time prayers were addressed to the
deity for the recovery of the patient; but as this particular
god had no priest, the prayers were offered by a minister
(<i>mataboole</i>), sometimes by two or three in succession, and
they were repeated five, six, or seven times a day. Their
general purport was as follows: "Here thou seest assembled
Finow and his chiefs, and the principal ministers (<i>matabooles</i>)
of thy favoured land; thou seest them humbled before thee.
We pray thee not to be merciless, but to spare the life of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the woman for the sake of her father, who has always been
attentive to every religious ceremony. But if thy anger is
justly excited by some crime or misdemeanour committed
by any other of us who are here assembled, we entreat thee
to inflict on the guilty one the punishment which he merits,
and not to let loose thy vengeance on one who was born but
as yesterday. For our own parts, why do we wish to live
but for the sake of Finow? But if his family is afflicted, we
are all afflicted, innocent as well as guilty. How canst thou
be merciless? Have regard for Finow and spare the life of
his daughter." When despite of prayers and the sacrifices
of pigs, the girl grew daily worse instead of better, she was
removed to many other consecrated enclosures of other gods,
one after the other, where the like fond prayers and fruitless
offerings were presented in the vain hope of staving off the
approach of death.<a name="FNanchor_77_204" id="FNanchor_77_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_204" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>But more precious sacrifices than the blood of hogs were
often laid at the feet of the angry gods. When a relation
of a superior rank was ill, it was a very common practice for
one or more of his or her inferior kinsfolk to have a little
finger, or a joint of a finger, cut off as a sacrifice to induce
the offended deity to spare the sick man or woman. So
common was the custom in the old days that there was
scarcely a person living in the Tonga islands who had not
thus lost one or both of his little fingers, or a considerable
portion of both. It does not appear that the operation
was very painful. Mariner witnessed more than once little
children quarrelling for the honour of having it performed on
them. The finger was laid flat upon a block of wood: a
knife, axe, or sharp stone was placed with the edge on the
joint to be severed, and a powerful blow with a hammer or
heavy stone effected the amputation. Sometimes an affectionate
relative would perform the operation on his or her
own hand. John Williams questioned a girl of eighteen
who had hacked off her own little finger with a sharp
shell to induce the gods to spare her sick mother. Generally
a joint was taken off at a time; but some persons had
smaller portions amputated to admit of the operation being
often repeated in case they had many superior relations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
who might be sick and require the sacrifice. When they
had no more joints which they could conveniently spare, they
rubbed the stumps of the mutilated fingers till the blood
streamed from the wounds; then they would hold up the
bleeding hands in hope of softening the heart of the angry
god.<a name="FNanchor_78_205" id="FNanchor_78_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_205" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Captain Cook understood that the operation was performed
for the benefit of the sufferers themselves to heal them
in sickness,<a name="FNanchor_79_206" id="FNanchor_79_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_206" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and the same view was apparently taken by the
French navigator Labillardi&egrave;re,<a name="FNanchor_80_207" id="FNanchor_80_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_207" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> but in this they were probably
mistaken; neither of them had an accurate knowledge
of the language, and they may easily have misunderstood
their informants. Perhaps the only person in the islands
who was exempt from the necessity of occasionally submitting
to the painful sacrifice was the divine chief Tooitonga,
who, as he ranked above everybody, even above the king,
could have no superior relation for whom to amputate a
finger-joint. Certainly we know that Tooitonga had not,
like the rest of his countrymen, to undergo the painful
operations of tattooing and circumcision; if he desired to
be tattooed or circumcised, he was obliged to go to other
islands, particularly to Samoa, for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_81_208" id="FNanchor_81_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_208" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Perhaps,
though this is not mentioned by our authorities, it would
have been deemed impious to shed his sacred blood in his
native land.</p>

<p>But sacrifices to the gods for the recovery of the sick
were not limited to the amputation of finger-joints. Not
uncommonly children were strangled for this purpose.<a name="FNanchor_82_209" id="FNanchor_82_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_209" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Thus
when Finow the king was grievously sick and seemed likely
to die, the prince, his son, and a young chief went out to
procure one of the king's own children by a female attendant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
to sacrifice it as a vicarious offering to the gods, that their
anger might be appeased and the health of its father restored.
They found the child sleeping in its mother's lap in a
neighbouring house; they took it away by force, and retiring
with it behind an adjacent burial-ground (<i>fytoca</i>) they
strangled it with a band of bark-cloth. Then they carried
it before two consecrated houses and a grave, at each place
gabbling a short but appropriate prayer to the god, that he
would intercede with the other gods in behalf of the dying
king, and would accept of this sacrifice as an atonement for
the sick man's crimes.<a name="FNanchor_83_210" id="FNanchor_83_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_210" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> When, not long afterwards, the
divine chief Tooitonga, in spite of his divinity, fell sick and
seemed like to die, one or other of his young relations had
a little finger cut off every day, as a propitiatory offering to
the gods for the sins of the saintly sufferer. But these
sacrifices remaining fruitless, recourse was had to greater.
Three or four children were strangled at different times,
and prayers were offered up by the priests at the consecrated
houses and burial-grounds (<i>fytocas</i>) but all in vain. The
gods remained deaf to the prayers of the priests; their
hearts were not touched by the cutting off of fingers or the
strangling of children; and the illness of the sacred chief
grew every day more alarming. As a last resort and
desperate remedy, the emaciated body of the dying man
was carried into the kitchen, the people imagining that such
an act of humility, performed on behalf of the highest
dignitary of the Tonga islands, would surely move the
deities to compassion and induce them to spare a life so
precious to his subjects.<a name="FNanchor_84_211" id="FNanchor_84_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_211" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The same curious remedy had
shortly before been resorted to for the benefit of the dying
or dead king, Finow the First: his body was carried into
the kitchen of the sacred chief, the Tooitonga, and there
placed over the hole in the ground where the fire was lighted
to cook victuals: "this was thought to be acceptable to the
gods, as being a mark of extreme humiliation, that the great
chief of all the Hapai islands and Vavaoo, should be laid
where the meanest class of mankind, the cooks, were
accustomed to operate."<a name="FNanchor_85_212" id="FNanchor_85_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_212" class="fnanchor">[85]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>The custom of strangling the relations of a sick chief
as a vicarious sacrifice to appease the anger of the deity and
ensure the recovery of the patient was found in vogue by
the first missionaries to Tonga before the arrival of Mariner.
When King Moom&#333;oe lay very sick and his death was hourly
expected, one of his sons sent for a younger brother under
pretence of wishing to cut off his little fingers as a sacrifice
to save the life of their dying father. The young man came,
whereupon his elder brother had him seized, strangled, and
buried within a few yards of the house where the missionaries
were living. Afterwards the fratricide came and mourned
over his murdered brother by sitting on the grave with his
elbows on his knees and covering his face with his hands.
In this posture he remained for a long time in silence, and
then departed very thoughtful. His motive for thus mourning
over the brother whom he had done to death is not
mentioned by the missionaries and was probably not known
to them. We may conjecture that it was not so much
remorse for his crime as fear of his brother's ghost, who
otherwise might have haunted him.<a name="FNanchor_86_213" id="FNanchor_86_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_213" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Morality, or at all
events a semblance of it, has often been thus reinforced by
superstitious terrors.</p>

<p>In recording this incident the missionaries make use of
an expression which seems to set the strangling of human
beings for the recovery of sick relations in a somewhat
different light. They say that "the prince of darkness has
impressed the idea on them, that the strength of the person
strangled will be transferred into the sick, and recover
him."<a name="FNanchor_87_214" id="FNanchor_87_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_214" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> On this theory the sacrifice acts, so to say,
mechanically without the intervention of a deity; the
life of the victim is transfused into the body of the patient
as a sort of tonic which strengthens and revives him.
Such a rite is therefore magical rather than religious; it
depends for its efficacy on natural causes, and not on the
pity and help of the gods. Yet the missionaries, who
record this explanation of the custom, elsewhere implicitly
accept the religious interpretation of such rites as vicarious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
sacrifices; for they say that among the superstitious notions
of the natives concerning spirits was one that "by strangling
some relations of the chief when he is sick, the deity will
be appeased, and he (that is, the sick chief) will recover."<a name="FNanchor_88_215" id="FNanchor_88_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_215" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Perhaps both explanations, the religious and the magical,
were assigned by the Tongans: consistency of thought is as
little characteristic of savage as of civilised man: provided
he attains his ends, he recks little of the road by which he
reaches them. An English sailor named Ambler, who had
resided for thirteen months in Tonga before the arrival of
the missionaries, told them, "that when a great chief lay
sick they often strangled their women, to the number of
three or four at a time."<a name="FNanchor_89_216" id="FNanchor_89_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_216" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Such a sacrifice is more likely
to have been religious than magical; we may suppose that
the victims were rather offered to the gods as substitutes
for the chief than killed to recruit his failing strength by
an infusion of their health and vigour. A chief would
probably have disdained the idea of drawing fresh energy
from the bodies of women, though he might be ready
enough to believe that the gods would consent to accept
their life as a proxy for his own. It is true that elsewhere,
notably in Uganda, human beings have been killed to
prolong the life of the king by directly transferring their
strength to him;<a name="FNanchor_90_217" id="FNanchor_90_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_217" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> but in such cases it would seem that the
victims have invariably been men and not women.</p>


<h4>&sect; 8. <i>The Doctrine of the Soul and its Destiny after Death</i></h4>

<p>Thus far we have dealt with the primary or superior
gods, who were believed to have been always gods, and
about whose origin nothing was known. We now pass to
a consideration of the secondary or inferior gods, whose
origin was perfectly well known, since they were all of
them the souls of dead chiefs or nobles, of whom some had
died or been killed in recent years. But before we take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
up the subject of their worship, it will be well to say a few
words on the Tongan doctrine of the human soul, since
these secondary deities were avowedly neither more nor
less than human souls raised to a higher power by death.</p>

<p>The Tongans, in their native state, before the advent
of Europeans, did not conceive of the soul as a purely
immaterial essence, that being a conception too refined for
the thought of a savage. They imagined it to be the finer
or more aeriform part of the body which leaves it suddenly
at the moment of death, and which may be thought to
stand in the same relation to the body as the perfume of
a flower to its solid substance. They had no proper word
to express this fine ethereal part of man; for the word <i>loto</i>,
though it might sometimes be used for that purpose, yet
rather means a man's disposition, inclination, passion, or
sentiment. The soul was supposed to exist throughout
the whole of the body, but to be particularly present in the
heart, the pulsation of which they regarded as the strength
and power of the soul. They did not clearly distinguish
between the life and the soul, but said that the right auricle
of the heart was the seat of life. They took the liver to
be the seat of courage, and professed to have remarked, on
opening dead bodies, that the largest livers belonged to the
bravest men, in which observation they were careful to
make allowance for the enlargement of livers consequent
on disease.<a name="FNanchor_91_218" id="FNanchor_91_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_218" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>They acknowledged that the <i>tooas</i> or lower order of
people had minds or souls; but they firmly believed that
these vulgar souls died with their bodies and consequently
had no future existence. In this aristocratic opinion the
generality of the commoners acquiesced, though some were
vain enough to think that they had souls like their betters,
and that they would live hereafter in Bolotoo. But the
orthodox Tongan doctrine restricted immortality to chiefs
and their ministers (the <i>matabooles</i>); at most, by a stretch
of charity, it extended the privilege to the <i>mooas</i> or third
estate; but it held out no hope of salvation to <i>tooas</i>, who
formed the fourth and lowest rank of society.<a name="FNanchor_92_219" id="FNanchor_92_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_219" class="fnanchor">[92]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Mariner's account, which I have followed, of the sharp
distinction which the Tongans drew between the immortality
of chiefs and the mortality of common people is confirmed
by the testimony of other and independent observers.
According to Captain Cook, while the souls of the chiefs
went immediately after death to the island of Boolootoo
(Bolotoo), the souls of the lower sort of people underwent
a sort of transmigration or were eaten by a bird
called <i>loata</i>, which walked upon their graves for that
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_93_220" id="FNanchor_93_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_220" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The first missionaries, who landed in Tongataboo
in 1797, report that the natives "believe the
immortality of the soul, which at death, they say, is
immediately conveyed in a very large fast-sailing canoe
to a distant country called Doobludha, which they describe
as resembling the Mahometan paradise. They call the
god of this region of pleasure Higgolayo, and esteem him
as the greatest and most powerful of all others, the rest
being no better than servants to him. This doctrine,
however, is wholly confined to the chiefs, for the <i>tooas</i>
(or lower order) can give no account whatever; as they
reckon the enjoyments of Doobludha above their capacity,
so they seem never to think of what may become of them
after they have served the purposes of this life."<a name="FNanchor_94_221" id="FNanchor_94_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_221" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> One
of these first missionaries was a certain George Veeson,
who had been a bricklayer before he undertook to convert
the heathen to Christianity. Wearying, however, of missionary
work, he deserted his brethren and betook himself to
the heathen, among whom he lived as one of them,
adopting the native garb, marrying native women, and
eagerly fighting in the wars of the natives among themselves.
In this way he acquired a considerable knowledge of the
Tongan language and customs, of which he made some
use in the account of his experiences which he published
anonymously after his return to England. Speaking of
Tongan ideas concerning the immortality of the soul he
says that he heard the chiefs speak much of Bulotu
(Bolotoo). "Into this region, however, they believed none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
were admitted but themselves. The Tuas, or lower class,
having no hope of sharing such bliss, seldom speculate
upon a futurity, which to them appears a subject lost in
shadows, clouds, and darkness."<a name="FNanchor_95_222" id="FNanchor_95_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_222" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The missionaries reported
to Commodore Wilkes that the spirits of all chiefs were
supposed to go to Bolotoo, while the souls of poor people
remained in this world to feed upon ants and lizards.<a name="FNanchor_96_223" id="FNanchor_96_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_223" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
With regard to the fate of the soul after death, the Tongans
universally and positively believed in the existence of a
great island, lying at a considerable distance to the north-west,
which they considered to be the abode of their gods
and of the souls of their dead nobles and their ministers
(the <i>matabooles</i>). This island they supposed to be much
larger than all their own islands put together, and to be
well stocked with all kinds of useful and ornamental plants,
always in a high state of perfection, and always bearing
the richest fruits and the most beautiful flowers according
to their respective natures; they thought that when these
fruits or flowers were plucked, others immediately took
their place, and that the whole atmosphere was filled with
the most delightful fragrance that the imagination can
conceive, exhaled from these immortal plants. The island,
too, was well stocked with the most beautiful birds, of all
imaginable kinds, as well as with abundance of hogs; and
all of these creatures were immortal, except when they
were killed to provide food for the gods. But the moment
a hog or a bird was killed, another live hog or bird came
into existence to supply its place, just as happened with
the fruits and flowers; and this, so far as they could
ascertain, was the only way in which plants and animals
were propagated in Bolotoo. So far away was the happy
island supposed to be that it was dangerous for living men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to attempt to sail thither in their canoes; indeed, except
by the express permission of the gods, they could not find
the island, however near they might come to it. They
tell, however, of a Tongan canoe which, returning from
Fiji, was driven by stress of weather to Bolotoo. The
crew knew not the place, and being in want of provisions
and seeing the country to abound in all sorts of fruits,
they landed and proceeded to pluck some bread-fruit.
But to their unspeakable astonishment they could no more
lay hold of the fruit than if it were a shadow; they walked
through the trunks of the trees and passed through the
substance of the houses without feeling any shock or
resistance. At length they saw some of the gods, who
passed through the men's bodies as if they were empty
space. These gods recommended them to go away immediately,
as they had no proper food for them, and they
promised them a fair wind and a speedy passage. So the
men put to sea, and sailing with the utmost speed they
arrived at Samoa, where they stayed two or three days.
Thence, again sailing very fast, they returned to Tonga,
where in the course of a few days they all died, not as a
punishment for having been at Bolotoo, but as a natural
consequence, the air of that place, as it were, infecting
mortal bodies with speedy death. The gods who dwell in
Bolotoo have no canoes, not requiring them; for if they
wish to be anywhere, there they are the moment the
wish is felt.<a name="FNanchor_97_224" id="FNanchor_97_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_224" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>It is said that in order to people Bolotoo the god Hikuleo
used to carry off the first-born sons of chiefs and other great
men, whom he transported to the island of the gods. To
such lengths did he go in this system of abduction that men
on earth grew very uneasy. Their ranks became thinner and
thinner. How was all this to end? At last the other gods
were moved to compassion. The two gods Tangaloa and
Maui laid hold of brother Hikuleo, passed a strong chain
round his waist and between his legs, and then taking the
chain by the ends they fastened one of them to the sky and
the other to the earth. Thus trussed up, the deity still
made many attempts to snatch away first-born sons; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
all his efforts were thwarted and baffled by the chain, for
no sooner did he dart out in one direction, than the chain
pulled him back in another. According to another, or the
same story, the excursions of the deity were further limited
by the length of his tail, the end of which was tethered to
the cave in which he resided; and though the tail was long
and allowed him a good deal of rope, do what he would, he
could not break bounds or obtain more than a very partial
view of what was going on in the rest of the world.<a name="FNanchor_98_225" id="FNanchor_98_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_225" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>In this curious story we may perhaps detect a tradition
of a time when among the Tongans, as among the Semites,
religion or superstition demanded the sacrifice of all first-born
sons, a barbarous custom which has been practised by not
a few peoples in various parts of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_99_226" id="FNanchor_99_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_226" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>The human soul after its separation from the body
at death was termed a <i>hotooa</i> or <i>atua</i>, that is, a god or spirit,
and was believed to exist in the shape of the body and to
have the same propensities as in life, but to be corrected by
a more enlightened understanding, by which it readily distinguished
good from evil, truth from falsehood, and right
from wrong. The souls dwelt for ever in the happy regions
of Bolotoo, where they bore the same names as in life and
held the same rank among themselves as they had held during
their mortal existence. But their lot in Bolotoo was in no
way affected by the good or evil which they had done on earth;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
for the Tongans did not believe in a future state of retribution
for deeds done in the body; they thought that the gods
punished crime in this present world, without waiting to
redress the balance of justice in the world to come. As
many of the nobles who passed at death to Bolotoo had been
warlike and turbulent in their life, it might naturally be
anticipated that they should continue to wage war on each
other in the land beyond the grave; but that was not so,
for by a merciful dispensation their understandings were so
much enlightened, or their tempers so much improved, by
their residence in Bolotoo, that any differences they might
have between themselves, or with the primitive gods, they
adjusted by temperate discussion without resort to violence;
though people in Tonga sometimes heard an echo and
caught a glimpse of these high debates in the rumble
of thunder and the flash of lightning.<a name="FNanchor_100_227" id="FNanchor_100_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_227" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In the blissful
abode of Bolotoo the souls of chiefs and nobles lived
for ever, being not subject to a second death, and there
they feasted upon all the favourite productions of
their native country, which grew also abundantly in the
happy island.<a name="FNanchor_101_228" id="FNanchor_101_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_228" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>A less cheerful picture, however, of the state of souls in
the other world was painted for Commodore Wilkes by the
missionaries who furnished him with information on the
native religion of the Tongans. According to them, the souls
were forced to become the servants, or rather slaves, of the
long-tailed deity Hikuleo, whose commands they had no
choice but to execute. His house and all things in it were
even constructed of the souls of the dead; and he went so
far as to make fences out of them and bars to his gates,
an indignity which must have been deeply resented by the
proud spirits of kings and nobles.<a name="FNanchor_102_229" id="FNanchor_102_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_229" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> How this gloomy picture
of the fate of souls in Bolotoo is to be reconciled with the
bright descriptions of it which I have drawn from the pages
of Mariner and Cook, it is not easy to say. Apparently we
must acquiesce in the discrepancy. That savages should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
entertain inconsistent views on the life after death need not
surprise us, when we remember how little accurate information
even civilised peoples possess on that momentous subject.</p>


<h4>&sect; 9. <i>The Souls of the Dead as Gods</i></h4>

<p>We have seen that according to Mariner, our best
authority on Tongan religion, the souls of dead nobles
ranked as gods, possessing all the powers and attributes of
the primary or original deities, though in an inferior degree.<a name="FNanchor_103_230" id="FNanchor_103_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_230" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Thus, like the primary gods, they had the power of returning
to Tonga to inspire priests, relations, or other people.<a name="FNanchor_104_231" id="FNanchor_104_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_231" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> For
example, the son of Finow, the King, used to be inspired
by the spirit of Toogoo Ahoo, a former king of Tonga, who
had been assassinated with the connivance of his successor,
Finow. One day Mariner asked this young chief how he
felt when he was visited by the spirit of the murdered
monarch. The chief replied that he could not well describe
his feelings, but the best he could say of it was, that he felt
himself all over in a glow of heat and quite restless and uncomfortable;
he did not feel his personal identity, as it
were, but seemed to have a mind differing from his own
natural mind, his thoughts wandering upon strange and
unusual topics, though he remained perfectly sensible of surrounding
objects. When Mariner asked him how he knew
it was the spirit of Toogoo Ahoo who possessed him, the
chief answered impatiently, "There's a fool! How can I
tell you how I knew it? I felt and knew it was so by a
kind of consciousness; my mind told me that it was Toogoo
Ahoo." Similarly Finow himself, the father of this young
man, used occasionally to be inspired by the ghost of
Moomooi, a former king of Tonga.<a name="FNanchor_105_232" id="FNanchor_105_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_232" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Again, the souls of dead nobles, like gods, had the power
of appearing in dreams and visions to their relatives and
others to admonish and warn them. It was thought, for
example, that Finow the king was occasionally visited by a
deceased son of his; the ghost did not appear, but announced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
his presence by whistling. Mariner once heard this whistling
when he was with the king and some chiefs in a house
at night; it was dark, and the sound appeared to come
from the loft of the house. In Mariner's opinion the sound
was produced by some trick of Finow's, but the natives
believed it to be the voice of a spirit.<a name="FNanchor_106_233" id="FNanchor_106_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_233" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Once more, when
Finow the king was himself dead, a noble lady who mourned
his death and generally slept on his grave, communicated to
his widow a dream which she had dreamed several nights at
the graveyard. She said that in her dream the late king
appeared to her, and, with a countenance full of sorrow,
asked why there yet remained so many evil-designing persons
in the islands; for he declared that, since he had been at
Bolotoo, he had been disturbed by the plots of wicked men
conspiring against his son; therefore was he come to warn
her of the danger. Finally, he bade her set in order
the pebbles on his grave, and pay every attention to his
burial-ground. With that he vanished.<a name="FNanchor_107_234" id="FNanchor_107_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_234" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In such dreams
of the reappearance of the recent dead we may discover
one source of the belief in the survival of the soul after
death.</p>

<p>But the gods appeared to mankind to warn, comfort, and
advise, not only in their own divine form but also in the
form of animals. Thus the primitive gods, according to
Mariner, sometimes entered into the living bodies of lizards,
porpoises, and a species of water snake. Hence these
creatures were much respected. The reason why gods
entered into porpoises was to take care of canoes. This
power of assuming the form of living animals, says Mariner,
belonged only to the original gods, and not to the deified
souls of chiefs.<a name="FNanchor_108_235" id="FNanchor_108_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_235" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> In thus denying that the spirits of the
dead were supposed sometimes to revisit the earth in animal
shapes Mariner was perhaps mistaken, for a different view
on the subject was apparently taken at a later time by Miss
Farmer, who had access to good sources of information.
She writes as follows: "Bulotu (Bolotoo) was peopled with
the spirits of departed chiefs and great persons of both sexes;
and it was to these chiefly that worship was paid and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
sacrifices were offered. These spirits in Bulotu were supposed
to act as intercessors with the supreme gods, who
were too highly exalted to be approached by men except
in this way. The spirits were in the habit of revisiting
earth. They would come in birds, or in fish as their shrines.
The tropic-bird, king-fisher, and sea-gull, the sea-eel, shark,
whale, and many other animals were considered sacred,
because they were favourite shrines of these spirit-gods.
The heathen never killed any of these creatures; and if, in
sailing, they chanced to find themselves in the neighbourhood
of a whale, they would offer scented oil or kava to him.
To some among the natives the cuttle-fish and the lizard
were gods; while others would lay offerings at the foot of
certain trees, with the idea of their being inhabited by
spirits. A rainbow or a shooting star would also command
worship."<a name="FNanchor_109_236" id="FNanchor_109_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_236" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>This account seems to imply that the spirits which took
the form of these animals, birds, and fish were believed to
be the souls of the dead returning from the spirit world to
revisit their old homes on earth. But even if we suppose
that herein the writer was mistaken, and that, as Mariner
affirmed, only the original and superior gods were deemed
capable of incarnation in animal shape, the account is still
valuable and interesting because it calls attention to a side
of Tongan religion on which our principal authority, Mariner,
is almost silent. That side comprises the worship of natural
objects, and especially of animals, birds, and fish, regarded
as embodiments of spirits, whether gods or ghosts. This
worship of nature, and particularly of animated nature, was
highly developed among the Samoans; it would be natural,
therefore, to find the same system in vogue among their
neighbours and near kinsmen the Tongans, though our
authorities on Tongan religion say little about it. The
system may with some appearance of probability be regarded
as a relic of a former practice of totemism.<a name="FNanchor_110_237" id="FNanchor_110_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_237" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>In recent years a considerable amount of evidence
bearing on the subject has been collected by Mr. E. E. V.
Collocot. He distinguishes the national Tongan gods from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the gods of tribes, clans, and small groups of allied households;
such a group of households, it appears, formed the
ordinary social unit. Indeed, he tells us that there was
nothing to prevent a man from setting up a tutelary deity
of his own, if he were so disposed; he might adopt almost
any object for the religious reverence of his household and
himself. Thus there was "a gradation in the divine
hierarchy from gods of populous tribes down to deities the
private possession of a very few."<a name="FNanchor_111_238" id="FNanchor_111_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_238" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Further, Mr. Collocot
found that most of the gods had sacred animals or other
natural objects associated with them,<a name="FNanchor_112_239" id="FNanchor_112_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_239" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and that the worshippers
were generally forbidden to eat the sacred animals of their
gods. He concludes that "in the period of which we have
information totemism has given way to a more highly
developed polytheism, but there are indications that the
development was by way of totemism."<a name="FNanchor_113_240" id="FNanchor_113_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_240" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Among the
facts which appear to support this conclusion we may note
the following.</p>

<p>There was a great god called Boolotoo Katoa, that is,
"the whole of Boolotoo (Bolotoo)," who had the dog for
his sacred animal; while the deity was being worshipped,
a dog lay at the side of the priest. This god had his
principal shrine at Boha in the eastern part of Tongataboo:
the district was of old the centre of government and the
residence of the Tooitonga.<a name="FNanchor_114_241" id="FNanchor_114_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_241" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Another god, whose name was
the King of the tribe or clan of Fonua (<i>Tui-Haafakafonua</i>),
had for his sacred animal a lizard, and for the convenience
of his departure, and presumably arrival, a tree or post was
always provided for him to crawl along. A handy post
or tree-stump was a regular part of his temple furnishings.<a name="FNanchor_115_242" id="FNanchor_115_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_242" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
Another god, whose name signifies "Proud Boastfulness of
the Season" (<i>Mofuta-ae-ta'u</i>), had for his sacred animal a
great sea-eel, which dwelt in an opening of the reef opposite
the village. This deity used to take it very ill if anybody
appeared on the beach near his abode wearing a turban or
whitened with lime; and should a man rashly disregard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the feelings of the divine eel in these respects, it was believed
that the deity would carry him off to his hole in the rock.<a name="FNanchor_116_243" id="FNanchor_116_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_243" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
Another god, named Haele-feke, used to manifest himself
in the form of an octopus (<i>feke</i>). Whenever an octopus
appeared in a certain pool, it was at once recognised as the
god, and the priestess immediately went and awaited him
at the shrine, which seems to have been a small raised
platform. Thither the people presently resorted, bringing
bunches of coco-nuts and coco-nut leaves and earth. The
priestess thereupon spoke as in the person of the octopus,
and apparently imitated the creature, presumably by
sprawling in the ungainly manner of an octopus. The
worshippers of this deity abstained from eating the flesh
of the octopus, and even from approaching a place where
other people were eating it. If any of them transgressed
the taboo, he was afflicted with complete baldness. Should
any of the worshippers find a dead octopus, they buried it
with all due ceremony in Teekiu, their principal village.<a name="FNanchor_117_244" id="FNanchor_117_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_244" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
The rail bird (<i>kalae</i>) was worshipped by some people, who
used to tie bunches of the birds together and carry them
about with them when they travelled; and the priest had
a bunch of the sacred birds tattooed as a badge on his
throat.<a name="FNanchor_118_245" id="FNanchor_118_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_245" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The clan Fainga'a had for its sacred animal the
mullet; and it is said that young mullets were tabooed to
the men of the clan.<a name="FNanchor_119_246" id="FNanchor_119_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_246" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> A family group in Haapai had the
owl for their sacred creature; if an owl hooted near a house
in the afternoon, it was a sign that there was a pregnant
woman in the household.<a name="FNanchor_120_247" id="FNanchor_120_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_247" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The god of Uiha in Haapai
was the Eel-in-the-Open-Sea (<i>Toke-i-Moana</i>); as usual, the
worshippers might not eat the flesh of eels or approach a
place where an eel was being cooked.<a name="FNanchor_121_248" id="FNanchor_121_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_248" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The clan Falefa
worshipped two goddesses, Jiji and Fainga'a, whose sacred
creature was the heron. Jiji was supposed to be incarnate
in the dark-coloured heron, and Fainga'a in the light-coloured
heron. When a pair of herons, one dark and the
other light-coloured, were seen flying together, people said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
that it was the two goddesses Jiji and Fainga'a.<a name="FNanchor_122_249" id="FNanchor_122_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_249" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> In the
island of Tofua there was a clan called the King of Tofua
(<i>Tui Tofua</i>), which had the shark for its god; members
of the clan might not eat the flesh of sharks, because they
believed themselves to be related to the fish; they said
that long ago some of the clansmen leaped from a canoe
into the sea and were turned into sharks.<a name="FNanchor_123_250" id="FNanchor_123_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_250" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Another god
who appeared in the form of a shark was Taufa of the Sea
(<i>Taufa-tahi</i>); but in another aspect he was a god of the
land (<i>Taufa-uta</i>) and a notable protector of gardens. To
secure his aid the husbandman had only to plait a coco-nut
leaf in the likeness of a shark and to hang it up in his
plantation; a garden thus protected was under a taboo
which no one would dare to violate. A Christian, who
ventured to thrust his hand in mockery into the maw of the
sham shark, had both his arms afterwards bitten off by a
real shark.<a name="FNanchor_124_251" id="FNanchor_124_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_251" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Other gods were recognised in the shape of
flying-foxes, shell-fish, and little blue and green lizards.<a name="FNanchor_125_252" id="FNanchor_125_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_252" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
We hear of two Tongan gods who had black volcanic
pebbles for their sacred objects,<a name="FNanchor_126_253" id="FNanchor_126_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_253" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and of one whose shrine
was the tree called <i>fehi</i>, the hard wood of which was
commonly used for making spears and canoes.<a name="FNanchor_127_254" id="FNanchor_127_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_254" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The gods
of Niua Fo'ou, one of the most distant islands of the
Tongan group, were three in number, to wit, the octopus,
pig's liver, and a large lump of coral. The worshippers of
the two former deities might not eat the divine octopus and
the divine pig's liver.<a name="FNanchor_128_255" id="FNanchor_128_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_255" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Christianity itself appears not to
have wholly extinguished the reverence of the natives for
the sacred animals of their clans. A much-respected native
minister of the Methodist Church informed Mr. Collocot
that to this day he gets a headache if he eats the sacred
animal of his clan, though other people may partake of the
creature, not only with impunity, but with relish.<a name="FNanchor_129_256" id="FNanchor_129_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_256" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Thus the worship of natural objects, and especially of
animals, fish, and birds, presents a close analogy to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Samoan system, as we shall see presently;<a name="FNanchor_130_257" id="FNanchor_130_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_257" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and it is not
without significance that tradition points to Samoa as the
original home from which the ancestors of the Tongans
migrated to their present abode.<a name="FNanchor_131_258" id="FNanchor_131_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_258" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> On the question of the
nature of the divine beings who presented themselves to
their worshippers in the form of animals, the evidence
collected by Mr. Collocot seems to confirm the statement of
Mariner, that only the primary or non-human gods were
believed capable of thus becoming incarnate; at least Mr.
Collocot gives no hint that the worshipful creatures were
supposed to be tenanted by the souls of the human dead;
in other words, there is nothing to show that the Tongan
worship of animals was based on a theory of transmigration.</p>

<p>The statement of Miss Farmer, which I have quoted,
that among the Tongans the souls of the dead were the
principal object of worship and received the most sacrifices,
is interesting and not improbable, though it is not confirmed
by Mariner. It may indeed, perhaps, be laid down as a
general principle that the worship of the dead tends constantly
to encroach on the worship of the high gods, who
are pushed ever farther into the background by the advent
of their younger rivals. It is natural enough that this
should be so. The affection which we feel for virtue, the
reverence and awe inspired by great talents and powerful
characters, persist long after the objects of our love and admiration
have passed away from earth, and we now render
to their memories the homage which we paid, or perhaps
grudged, to the men themselves in their lifetime. For us
they seem still to exist; with their features, their characteristic
turns of thought and speech still fresh in our memories,
we can hardly bring ourselves to believe that they have
utterly ceased to be, that nothing of them remains but the
lifeless dust which we have committed to the earth. The
heart still clings fondly to the hope, if not to the belief,
that somewhere beyond our ken the loved and lost ones are
joined to the kindred spirits who have gone before in that
unknown land, where, in due time, we shall meet them again.
And as with affection, so with reverence and fear; they
also are powerful incentives to this instinctive belief in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
continued existence of the dead. The busy brain that explored
the heights and depths of this mysterious universe&mdash;the
glowing imagination that conjured up visions of beauty born,
as we fondly think, for immortality&mdash;the aspiring soul and
vaulting ambition that founded or overturned empires and
shook the world&mdash;are they now no more than a few mouldering
bones or a handful of ashes under their marble monuments?
The mind of most men revolts from a conclusion so
derogatory to what they deem the dignity of human nature;
and so to satisfy at once the promptings of the imagination
and the impulse of the heart, men gradually elevate their
dead to the rank of saints and heroes, who in course of time
may easily pass by an almost insensible transition to the
supreme place of deities. It is thus that, almost as far back
as we can trace the gropings of the human mind, man has
been perpetually creating gods in his own likeness.</p>

<p>In a pantheon thus constantly recruited by the accession
of dead men, the recruits tend to swamp the old deities by
sheer force of numbers; for whereas the muster-roll of the
original gods is fixed and unchangeable, the newcomers form
a great host which is not only innumerable but perpetually
on the increase, for who can reckon up the tale of the
departed or set bounds to the ravages of death? Indeed,
where the deification of the dead is carried to its logical
limit, a new god is born for every man that dies; though in
Tonga against such an extreme expansion of the spiritual
hierarchy, and a constant overcrowding of Bolotoo, a solid
barrier was interposed by the Tongan doctrine which opened
the gates of paradise only to noblemen.<a name="FNanchor_132_259" id="FNanchor_132_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_259" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<h4>&sect; 10. <i>Temples and Tombs: Megalithic Monuments</i></h4>

<p>On the whole it seems reasonable to conclude that in
Tonga the distinction between the original superhuman
deities and the new human gods tended to be obliterated in
the minds of the people. More and more, we may suppose,
the deified spirits of dead men usurped the functions
and assimilated themselves to the character of the ancient
divinities. Yet between these two classes of worshipful
beings Mariner draws an important distinction which we must
not overlook. He says that these new human gods, these
souls of deified nobles, "have no houses dedicated to them,
but the proper places to invoke them are their graves, which
are considered sacred, and are therefore as much respected
as consecrated houses."<a name="FNanchor_133_260" id="FNanchor_133_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_260" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> If this distinction is well founded,
the consecrated house or temple, as we may call it, of an
original god was quite different from the grave at which a
new god, that is, a dead man or woman, was worshipped.
But in spite of the high authority of Mariner it seems
doubtful whether the distinction which he makes between
the temples of the old gods and the tombs of the new ones
was always recognised in practice, and whether the two were
not apt to be confounded in the minds even of the natives.
The temples of the gods, as we have seen, did not differ in
shape and structure from the houses of men, and similar
houses, as we shall see, were also built on the graves of
kings and chiefs and even of common people. What was
easier than to confuse the two classes of spirit-houses, the
houses of gods and the houses of dead kings or chiefs,
especially when the memory of these potentates had grown
dim and their human personality had been forgotten?
Certainly European observers have sometimes been in doubt
as to whether places to which the natives paid religious
reverence were temples or graves. In view of this ambiguity
I propose to examine some of the descriptions which have
been given by eye-witnesses of the sacred structures and
enclosure which might be interpreted either as temples or
tombs. The question has a double interest and importance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
first, in its bearing on the theory, enunciated by Herbert
Spencer, that temples are commonly, if not universally, derived
from tombs,<a name="FNanchor_134_261" id="FNanchor_134_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_261" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and gods from dead men; and secondly,
in its bearing on the question of the origin and meaning of
megalithic monuments; for not a few of the tombs of
Tongan kings and sacred chiefs are constructed in part of
very large stones.</p>

<p>I will begin with the evidence of Captain Cook, an
excellent observer and faithful witness. He paid two visits
to the Tonga islands, a short one in 1773, and a longer
one of between two and three months in 1777. Speaking
of his first visit to Tongataboo in 1773, he writes as
follows:</p>

<p>"After sitting here some time, and distributing some
presents to those about us, we signified our desire to see the
country. The chief immediately took the hint, and conducted
us along a lane that led to an open green, on the one
side of which was a house of worship built on a mount that
had been raised by the hand of man, about sixteen or eighteen
feet above the common level. It had an oblong figure, and
was inclosed by a wall or parapet of stone, about three feet
in height. From this wall the mount rose with a gentle
slope, and was covered with a green turf. On the top of it
stood the house, which had the same figure as the mount,
about twenty feet in length, and fourteen or sixteen broad.
As soon as we came before the place, every one seated himself
on the green, about fifty or sixty yards from the front of
the house. Presently came three elderly men; who seated
themselves between us and it, and began a speech, which I
understood to be a prayer, it being wholly directed to the
house. This lasted about ten minutes; and then the priests,
for such I took them to be, came and sat down along with
us, when we made them presents of such things as were
about us. Having then made signs to them that we wanted
to view the premises, my friend Attago immediately got up,
and going with us, without showing the least backwardness,
gave us full liberty to examine every part of it.</p>

<p>"In the front were two stone steps leading to the top of
the wall; from this the ascent to the house was easy, round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
which was a fine gravel walk. The house was built, in all
respects, like to their common dwelling-houses; that is, with
posts and rafters; and covered with palm thatch. The eaves
came down within about three feet of the ground, which
space was filled up with strong matting made of palm leaves,
as a wall. The floor of the house was laid with fine gravel;
except in the middle, where there was an oblong square of
blue pebbles, raised about six inches higher than the floor.
At one corner of the house stood an image rudely carved in
wood, and on one side lay another; each about two feet in
length. I, who had no intention to offend either them or
their gods, did not so much as touch them, but asked Attago,
as well as I could, if they were <i>Eatuas</i>, or gods. Whether
he understood me or no, I cannot say; but he immediately
turned them over and over, in as rough a manner as he
would have done any other log of wood, which convinced
me that they were not there as representatives of the Divinity.
I was curious to know if the dead were interred there, and
asked Attago several questions relative thereto; but I was
not sure that he understood me; at least I did not understand
the answers he made, well enough to satisfy my
inquiries. For the reader must know, that at our first
coming among these people, we hardly could understand
a word they said. Even my Otaheitean youth, and the man
on board the <i>Adventure</i>, were equally at a loss: but more of
this by and by. Before we quitted the house we thought it
necessary to make an offering at the altar. Accordingly we
laid down upon the blue pebbles, some medals, nails, and
several other things; which we had no sooner done than my
friend Attago took them up, and put them in his pocket.
The stones with which the walls were made that inclosed
this mount, were some of them nine or ten feet by four, and
about six inches thick. It is difficult to conceive how they
can cut such stones out of the coral rocks.</p>

<p>"This mount stood in a kind of grove open only on the
side which fronted the high road, and the green on which
the people were seated. At this green or open place, was a
junction of five roads, two or three of which appeared to be
very public ones. The groves were composed of several
sorts of trees. Among others was the <i>Etoa</i> tree, as it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
called at Otaheite, of which are made clubs, etc., and a kind
of low palm, which is very common in the northern parts of
New Holland.</p>

<p>"After we had done examining this place of worship,
which in their language is called <i>a-fiat-tou-ca</i>, we desired to
return."<a name="FNanchor_135_262" id="FNanchor_135_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_262" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>A little farther on, still speaking of his first visit to
Tonga, Captain Cook observes: "So little do we know of
their religion, that I hardly dare mention it. The buildings
called <i>afiatoucas</i>, before mentioned, are undoubtedly set apart
for this purpose. Some of our gentlemen were of opinion,
that they were merely burying-places. I can only say, from
my own knowledge, that they are places to which particular
persons directed set speeches, which I understood to be
prayers, as hath been already related. Joining my opinion
with that of others, I was inclined to think that they are set
apart to be both temples and burying-places, as at Otaheite,
or even in Europe. But I have no idea of the images being
idols; not only from what I saw myself, but from Mr.
Wales's informing me that they set one of them up, for him
and others to shoot at."<a name="FNanchor_136_263" id="FNanchor_136_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_263" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Thus Captain Cook and his party were divided in opinion
as to whether the house on the mound, within its walled
enclosure built of great stones, was a temple or a tomb.
Captain Cook himself called it simply a "house of worship"
and a "place of worship," but he inclined to the view that it
was both a temple and a burying-place, and in this opinion
he was probably right. The native name which he applied
to it, <i>afiatouca</i>, means a burial-place; for it is doubtless
equivalent to <i>fytoca</i>, a word which Mariner explains to mean
"a burying-place, including the grave, the mount in which it
is sunk, and a sort of shed over it."<a name="FNanchor_137_264" id="FNanchor_137_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_264" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Moreover, the oblong
square of blue pebbles, which Captain Cook observed on the
floor of the house on the mound, and which he regarded as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the altar, speaks also in favour of the house being a tomb;
for Mariner has described how the mourners brought white
and black pebbles to the house which stood over the grave
of King Finow, and how they "strewed the inside of the
house with the white ones, and also the outside about the
<i>fytoca</i>, as a decoration to it: the black pebbles they strewed
only upon those white ones, which covered the ground directly
over the body, to about the length and breadth of a man,
in the form of a very eccentric ellipse. After this, the house
over the <i>fytoca</i>," continues Mariner, "was closed up at both
ends with a reed fencing, reaching from the eaves to the
ground, and, at the front and back, with a sort of basket-work,
made of the young branches of the cocoa-nut tree,
split and interwoven in a very curious and ornamental way,
to remain till the next burial, when they are to be taken
down, and, after the conclusion of the ceremony, new ones
are to be put up in like manner."<a name="FNanchor_138_265" id="FNanchor_138_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_265" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> This description of the
house over King Finow's grave agrees so closely with Captain
Cook's description of the house in the <i>afiatouca</i>, that we may
with much probability regard the latter as a tomb, and
suppose that the "oblong square of blue pebbles," which
Cook regarded as an altar and on which he laid down his
offering, marked the place of the body in the grave: it was
at once an altar and a tombstone.</p>

<p>On his second and more prolonged visit to the Tonga
islands, Captain Cook expressed, with more confidence, his
opinion that the <i>fiatookas</i>, as he calls them, were at once
burial-grounds and places of worship. Thus he says: "Their
<i>morais</i> or <i>fiatookas</i> (for they are called by both names, but
mostly by the latter), are, as at Otaheite, and many other
parts of the world, burying-grounds and places of worship;
though some of them seemed to be only appropriated to the
first purpose; but these were small, and, in every other
respect, inferior to the others."<a name="FNanchor_139_266" id="FNanchor_139_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_266" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Again, in another passage
he describes one of the more stately of these temple-tombs.
He says: "Some of us, accompanied by a few of the king's
attendants, and Omai as our interpreter, walked out to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
a view of a <i>fiatooka</i>, or burying-place, which we had observed
to be almost close by the house, and was much more extensive,
and seemingly of more consequence, than any we had
seen at the other islands. We were told, that it belonged to
the king. It consisted of three pretty large houses, situated
upon a rising ground, or rather just by the brink of it, with
a small one, at some distance, all ranged longitudinally.
The middle house of the three first, was by much the largest,
and placed in a square, twenty-four paces by twenty-eight,
raised about three feet. The other houses were placed on
little mounts, raised artificially to the same height. The
floors of these houses, as also the tops of the mounts round
them, were covered with loose, fine pebbles, and the whole
was inclosed by large flat stones of hard coral rock, properly
hewn, placed on their edges; one of which stones measured
twelve feet in length, two in breadth, and above one in
thickness. One of the houses, contrary to what we had
seen before, was open on one side; and within it were
two rude, wooden busts of men; one near the entrance, and
the other farther in. On inquiring of the natives, who had
followed us to the ground, but durst not enter here, What
these images were intended for? they made us as sensible
as we could wish, that they were merely memorials of some
chiefs who had been buried there, and not the representations
of any deity. Such monuments, it should seem, are
seldom raised; for these had probably been erected several
ages ago. We were told, that the dead had been buried in
each of these houses; but no marks of this appeared. In
one of them, was the carved head of an Otaheite canoe, which
had been driven ashore on their coast, and deposited here.
At the foot of the rising ground was a large area, or grass-plot,
with different trees planted about it; amongst which
were several of those called <i>etoa</i>, very large. These, as they
resemble the cypresses, had a fine effect in such a place.
There was also a row of low palms near one of the houses,
and behind it a ditch, in which lay a great number of old
baskets."<a name="FNanchor_140_267" id="FNanchor_140_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_267" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Between the departure of Cook and the arrival of
Mariner the first Protestant missionaries were fortunate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
enough to witness the burial of a king of Tonga, by name
Moom&#333;oe. Their description of it and of the royal tomb
entirely bears out the observations and conclusions of Captain
Cook. The <i>fiatooka</i> or burial-ground, they tell us, "is
situated on a spot of ground about four acres. A mount
rises with a gentle slope about seven feet, and is about one
hundred and twenty yards in circumference at the base;
upon the top stands a house neatly made, which is about
thirty feet long, and half that in width. The roof is
thatched, and the sides and ends left open. In the middle
of this house is the grave, the sides, ends, and bottom of
which are of coral stone, with a cover of the same: the
floor of the house is of small stones. The <i>etoa</i> and other
trees grow round the <i>fiatooka</i>."<a name="FNanchor_141_268" id="FNanchor_141_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_268" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Into this grave, or rather
stone vault, the missionaries saw the king's body lowered.
The stone which covered the vault was eight feet long,
four feet broad, and one foot thick. This massive stone
was first raised and held in suspense by means of two
great ropes, the ends of which were wound round two
strong piles driven into the ground at the end of the house.
The ropes were held by about two hundred men, who,
when the king's body had been deposited in the grave,
slowly lowered the great stone and covered the vault.<a name="FNanchor_142_269" id="FNanchor_142_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_269" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
Some years later Mariner witnessed the funeral of another
king of Tonga, Finow the First; and he similarly describes
how the tomb was a large stone vault, sunk about ten feet
deep in the ground, the covering stone of which was hoisted
by the main strength of a hundred and fifty or two hundred
men pulling at the two ends of a rope; when the bodies of
the king and his daughter had been laid side by side in the
vault the massive stone was lowered by the men with a
great shout.<a name="FNanchor_143_270" id="FNanchor_143_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_270" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The number of the men required to raise
and lower these great stones gives us some idea of their
weight.</p>

<p>Thus far we have been dealing only with the tombs
of the civil kings of Tonga. But far more stately and
massive are the tombs of the sacred kings or pontiffs, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Tooitongas, which still exist and still excite the curiosity
and admiration of European observers. The Tongan name
for these tombs is <i>langi</i>, which properly means "sky," also
"a band of singers"; but there appears to be no connexion
between these different meanings of the word.<a name="FNanchor_144_271" id="FNanchor_144_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_271" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The tombs
are situated in Tongataboo, not far from Mooa, the old
capital of the island. They stand near the south-eastern
shore of the lagoon, which, under the name of the Mooa
Inlet, penetrates deeply into the northern side of Tongataboo.
Beginning at the northern outskirts of the village
of Labaha, they stretch inland for more than half a mile
into the forest.<a name="FNanchor_145_272" id="FNanchor_145_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_272" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> They are of various constructions and
shapes. Some consist of a square enclosure, on the level
of the ground, the boundary walls being formed of large
stones; while at each corner of the square two high stones,
rising above the wall, are placed upright at right angles to
each other and in a line with their respective sides.<a name="FNanchor_146_273" id="FNanchor_146_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_273" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> But
apparently the more usual and characteristic type of tomb
has the form of a truncated pyramid or oblong platform
raised in a series of steps or terraces, which are built of
massive blocks of coral. The number of steps or terraces
seems to vary from one to four according to the height of
the monument.<a name="FNanchor_147_274" id="FNanchor_147_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_274" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> It is much to be regretted that no one
has yet counted and mapped out these tombs and recorded
the names of their royal or divine occupants, so far as they
are remembered; but a trace of the religious awe which
once invested this hallowed ground still avails to keep it
inviolate. A proposal which Sir Basil Thomson made to
clear away the forest and preserve the tombs was very
coldly received; in the eyes of the natives, professing
Christians as they are, it probably savoured of sacrilege.
The ancient custom was to clear the ground about every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
new tomb, and after the interment to suffer the tropical
undergrowth to swallow it up for ever. Nowadays no holy
pontiffs are borne to their last resting-place in these hallowed
shades; so the forest is never cleared, and nature is left
free to run wild. In consequence the tombs are so overgrown
and overshadowed that it is difficult to photograph
them in the gloomy and tangled thicket. Great <i>ifi</i> trees<a name="FNanchor_148_275" id="FNanchor_148_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_275" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
overhang them: banyan-trees have sprouted on the terraces
and thrust their roots into every crevice, mantling the stones
with a lacework of tendrils, which year by year rend huge
blocks asunder, until the original form of the terrace is
almost obliterated. Sir Basil Thomson followed the chain
of tombs for about half a mile, but on each occasion his
guides told him that there were other smaller tombs farther
inland. The tombs increase in size and in importance as
they near the shore of the lagoon, and to seven or eight of
the larger ones the names of the occupants can be assigned;
but the names of the sacred chiefs who sleep in the smaller
tombs inland are quite forgotten. Some of them are mere
enclosures of stones, not squared, but taken haphazard from
the reef.<a name="FNanchor_149_276" id="FNanchor_149_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_276" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The tombs were built in the lifetime of the sacred
chiefs who were to lie in them, and their size accordingly
affords a certain measure of the power and influence of the
great men interred in them. Among the largest is the
tomb which goes by the name of Telea, though it is said
to contain no body, Telea himself being buried in the tomb
next to it. We are told that, dissatisfied with the first
sepulchre that was built for him, he replaced it by the
other, which is also of great size. The most modern of
the tombs is that of Laufilitonga, the last to bear the title
of Tooitonga. He died a Christian about 1840 and was
buried in the tomb of very inferior size which crowns the
village cemetery. The most ancient cannot be dated; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
that some are older than A.D. 1535 may be inferred
from the tradition that Takalaua, a Tooitonga, was
assassinated about that time because he was a tyrant who
compelled his people to drag great stones from Liku, at
the back of the island, to the burial ground at Mooa; the
distance is about a mile and a half.<a name="FNanchor_150_277" id="FNanchor_150_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_277" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Profile of the Steps.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The first, so far as I know, to see and describe these
remarkable tombs were the earliest missionaries to Tonga
about the end of the eighteenth century. Speaking of the
burial ground at Mooa, where lay interred the divine chiefs
whose title was Tooitonga and whose family name was
Futtaf&#257;ihe or Fatafehi, the missionaries observe that "the
<i>fiatookas</i> are remarkable. There lie the Futtaf&#257;ihes for
many generations, some vast and ruinous, which is the case
with the largest; the house on the top of it is fallen, and
the area and tomb itself overgrown with wood and
weeds."<a name="FNanchor_151_278" id="FNanchor_151_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_278" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Later on they had the advantage of being conducted over
the august cemetery by the Futtaf&#257;ihe or Tooitonga of the
day in person, who gave them some explanations concerning
these sepulchres of his ancestors. To quote their description,
they say that the tombs "lie ranged in a line eastward from
his house, among a grove of trees, and are many in number,
and of different constructions: some, in a square form, were
not in the least raised above the level of the common
ground; a row of large stones formed the sides, and at
each corner two high stones were placed upright at right
angles to each other, and in a line with their respective
sides: others were such as the brethren describe that of
Moom&#333;oe to be: and a third sort were built square like the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
first; the largest of which was at the base one hundred and
fifty-six feet by one hundred and forty; it had four steps
from the bottom to the top, that run quite round the pile:
one stone composed the height of each step, a part of it
being sunk in the ground; and some of these stones in the
wall of the lower are immensely large; one, which I
measured, was twenty-four feet by twelve, and two feet
thick; these Futtaf&#257;ihe informed me were brought in
double canoes from the island of Lefooga. They are coral
stone, and are hewn into a tolerably good shape, both with
respect to the straightness of their sides and flatness of
their surfaces. They are now so hardened by the weather,
that the great difficulty we had in breaking a specimen of
one corner made it not easy to conjecture how the labour
of hewing them at first had been effected; as, by the marks
of antiquity which some of them bear, they must have been
built long before Tasman showed the natives an iron tool.
Besides the trees which grow on the top and sides of most
of them, there are the <i>etooa</i>, and a variety of other trees
about them; and these, together with the thousands of bats
which hang on their branches, all contribute to the awful
solemnity of those sepulchral mansions of the ancient chiefs.
On our way back Futtaf&#257;ihe told us that all the <i>fiatookas</i>
we had seen were built by his ancestors, who also lay
interred in them; and as there appeared no reason to
doubt the truth of this, it proves that a supreme power in
the government of the island must for many generations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
have been in the family of the Futtaf&#257;ihes: for though
there were many <i>fiatookas</i> in the island, the brethren, who
had seen most of them, said they were not to be compared
to these for magnitude, either in the pile or the
stones which compose them."<a name="FNanchor_152_279" id="FNanchor_152_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_279" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Some thirty years later the tombs of the Tooitongas
were visited and described by the French explorer, J. Dumont
d'Urville. His description is worth quoting. He says:
"I directed my steps to the splendid <i>fa&iuml;-tokas</i> of the Fata-Fa&iuml;s.
As these monuments are essentially taboo, in the
absence of the Tooi-tonga no one looks after their upkeep,
and they are now buried on every side among dark masses
of trees and almost impenetrable thickets. Hence we had
some difficulty in approaching them, and it was impossible
for us to get a single general view of the whole of these
structures, which must have a somewhat solemn effect when
the ground is properly cleared.</p>

<p>"For the most part these mausoleums have the form of
great rectangular spaces surrounded by enormous blocks of
stone, of which some are as much as from fifteen to twenty
feet long by six or eight broad and two feet thick. The
most sumptuous of these monuments have four or five rows
of steps, making up a total height of eighteen or twenty feet.
The interior is filled up with shingle and fragments of
unhewn coral. One of these <i>fa&iuml;-tokas</i>, which I measured, was
a hundred and eighty feet long by a hundred and twenty
broad. At one of the upper angles I observed a block of
considerable size with a deep cutting in it. I was told that
it was the seat of the Tooi-tonga-fafine<a name="FNanchor_153_280" id="FNanchor_153_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_280" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>; it was there that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
she sat to preside at the ceremony of the funeral of the
Tooi-tonga.</p>

<p>"Some of these edifices were of an oval form, but they
were much smaller. Each of them was surmounted by a
small hut, which served as an oratory or house for the spirit of
the dead; most of them have been destroyed by the lapse of
time, and only traces of them are left scattered on the ground.</p>

<p>"The enormous blocks of coral employed in the construction
of these monuments have all been brought by sea
from Hifo to Mooa. They were got on the shore of the sea
at Hifo, were hewn on the spot, and were transported in
great canoes; then they were landed at Mooa and drawn
on rollers to the place of their destination. These monuments
are astonishing evidence of the patience which they
must have demanded on the part of these islanders; they
were ocular testimony to me of the high degree of civilisation
which the natives had reached. Man must have risen to
ideas of a much higher order than those of a simple savage
before he would take so great pains for the single object of
consecrating the memory of his chiefs.</p>

<p>"Such tombs are no longer built in Tongataboo: people
content themselves with simple mounds surrounded by a
row of posts or even an ordinary palisade. However,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Singleton assured me that Finow the Younger had erected
two great <i>fa&iuml;-tokas</i> of stone in Vavao, one for the last Tooitonga,
and one for his father."<a name="FNanchor_154_281" id="FNanchor_154_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_281" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The Frenchman, De Sainson, who accompanied Dumont
d'Urville on his visit to Tongataboo, has also described the
tombs of the Tooitongas at Mooa from personal observation.
I will quote his description: "It is in the heart of the forest
that the ancient inhabitants of these countries, who idolized
their Kings (Tooi-tongas), placed the tombs of that sacred
race. These monuments of a more enterprising age still
astonish the beholder by their mass and their extent.
The <i>fai-tokas</i>, as these burial-places are called, are artificial
eminences, on the top of which, in the form of a square, are
three or four crosses of great granitic blocks arranged as
steps, of which each block may be four or five feet high.
If there is only a single step on the top of the mound, it is
because only a single Tooi-tonga sleeps there in the grave;
if the bones of a whole family are deposited in a common
tomb, three or four steps, one above the other, mark their
union in death. Some of these monuments which contain
only a single body are arranged in an oval. I counted more
than twelve of these immense structures, and yet we left a
great many aside. I counted more than one stone between
eight and fifteen feet long; and I conceived a high idea of
those men of ancient days who erected over the remains of
their kings these imperishable mausoleums, in an island based
on coral, where it would be difficult to find a stone of two
feet square. I imagined them to be very different from their
effeminate descendants, those men of old who went in their
canoes more than a hundred and fifty leagues to look for the
enormous blocks of which these tombs are built, who cut
them without the help of iron, and succeeded, by means
unknown, in planting them on these hillocks, where by their
own weight they are fixed for ever, like the Druidical
monuments of Brittany, which one would say were dropped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
on earth rather by the magic of talismans than by the power
of man.</p>

<p>"The present inhabitants of Tonga contemplate with a
pious awe the fruit of the labours and patience of their
forefathers, without dreaming for a moment of imitating
them in their noble enterprises. A distant voyage affrights
these degenerate scions of a hardy race, and the great canoes
which still survive, sheltered under sheds very skilfully built,
are little more than the useless encumbrance of chiefs grown
languid in the long peace which has infected the whole
people with habits of indolence.</p>

<p>"The most recent tombs consist of a small house
enclosed on all sides, built on a rising ground, and shaded
by a circle of mimosas, a tree sacred to the dead. Most of
the illustrious graves are clustered together at Mafanga, a
large village of which the whole territory is sacred on
account of the hallowed relics which it contains. Along
with the corpse they bury at the depth of a few inches
small wooden effigies representing persons of both sexes.
I had occasion to unearth a few of these little statues, and
I remarked in them an astonishing feeling for artistic
design."<a name="FNanchor_155_282" id="FNanchor_155_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_282" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Some sixteen years later a Catholic missionary, living
among the heathen population of Tongataboo, wrote thus:
"Nothing equals the care which they take in the burial of
their dead. As soon as a native has breathed his last, the
neighbours are informed, and immediately all the women
come to weep about the corpse. Here the men never weep.
The body is kept thus for a day or two, during which they
are busy building a tomb near the dwelling of the deceased's
family. The sepulchral house is neat, built on an eminence,
surrounded by a pretty fence of choice bamboos; the
enclosure is planted with all kinds of odoriferous shrubs,
especially evergreens. Finally, the monument is covered
by a roof artistically constructed. For the tombs of kings
and the greatest chiefs they go to distant islands to find
huge stones to crown the grave. I have seen one twenty-four
feet long by eight broad and at least eighteen inches thick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
One of these tombs was built by the natives of Wallis Island,
who brought the enormous blocks in immense canoes. It
is wonderful for these peoples."<a name="FNanchor_156_283" id="FNanchor_156_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_283" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Captain Erskine, who visited Tongataboo in 1849, says
that "near the landing-place at the village of Holobeka, off
which we were lying, we saw overshadowed with trees, one
of the <i>faitokas</i>, or old burial-places of the country, which,
although no longer 'tabu,' are still in some cases used as
places of sepulture, and very carefully kept. This one was
an oblong square platform a few feet high, surrounded by
a stone wall, the interior being beautifully paved with
coloured corals and gravel; the house or temple, which
Captain Cook and others describe as occupying the centre,
having been, I suppose, removed. I saw but one other of
these monuments during our stay among the islands, the
largest of which stands on several rows of steps, as described
by all former visitors."<a name="FNanchor_157_284" id="FNanchor_157_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_284" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>Thomas West, who lived as a missionary in the
Tongan islands from 1846 to 1855, tells us that "chiefs
were usually interred in tombs, constructed of blocks of
sandstone, cut from suitable localities by the seashore,
where, at a little depth from the surface, layers of hard
and durable sandstone are found, even on many of the
coralline islands. In several of the ancient burial-places,
similar stones, arranged in terraces, surround the whole
enclosure. Some of these are of immense size, and seem
to indicate the possession, on the part of former inhabitants,
either of greater energy than the present race, or of better
tools and appliances. The burial-places of the Tonguese
are always surrounded by the most imposing foliage of the
tropics, and placed in sequestered spots. A mound of earth
is raised, of dimensions varying with the necessities of the
place; and, whenever a grave is opened within the limits
of this mound, it is always filled up with beautiful white
sand, and never contains more than one body. No particle
of clay or earthy mould is allowed to touch the remains of
the dead. The sand is brought in baskets by the chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
mourners, who sometimes sail or journey many miles to
procure it; and each person pours the contents into the
grave until it is sufficiently filled up. The top of the grave
is, afterwards, carefully tended and decorated with black
pebbles and red coral, arranged in various devices, which
have a very pretty effect. Small houses are also placed
over the tombs of the chiefs and gentry."<a name="FNanchor_158_285" id="FNanchor_158_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_285" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>In more recent years the tombs of the Tooitongas at
Mooa have been visited by Sir Basil Thomson, who has
described and discussed them.<a name="FNanchor_159_286" id="FNanchor_159_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_286" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> From an anonymous
pamphlet called <i>The Wairarapa Wilderness</i>, written by the
passengers of the s.s. <i>Wairarapa</i> and published in 1884, Sir
Basil Thomson quotes a passage containing a description
of the tombs, with measurements which, he tells us, are
accurate as far as they go. From it I will extract a few
particulars. The writers inform us that the tombs are built
of blocks of coral which vary in length and thickness; some
of the largest they found to be from fifteen to eighteen feet
long and from one and a half to two feet thick. The largest
measured by them is twenty-two feet long and two feet thick
and stands between seven and eight feet above the ground.
This great stone, now split in two, is at the middle of the
lowest step of one of the pyramidal tombs. The height of
the steps varies much in the different pyramids; one step
was found to be four feet high. The breadth of each step
is three feet or more: it has been carefully levelled and
covered with coral gravel. The stones fit very closely and
are very regular at top and bottom throughout the tiers.
The corners of one pyramid observed by the writers are
formed of huge rectangular stones, which seem to have been
put in position before they were finally faced. On the
upper surface of the largest stone is a deep hollow about
the size and shape of a large chestnut mortar. Sir Basil
Thomson, who has examined this hollow, believes it to be
a natural cavity which has been artificially smoothed by a
workman. He suggests that it may have been lined with
leaves and used as a bowl for brewing kava at the funeral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
ceremonies. On one mound the writers of the pamphlet
remarked a large flat stone, some five and a half feet square;
and in several of the tombs they noticed huge slabs of
volcanic stone placed indiscriminately side by side with
blocks of coral. The writers measured the bases of three
of the tombs and found them to be about two chains (one
hundred and thirty-two feet) long by a chain and a half
(ninety-nine feet) broad; the base of a fourth was even
larger.<a name="FNanchor_160_287" id="FNanchor_160_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_287" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Surveying these various accounts of the tombs of the
Tooitongas or sacred chiefs, we may perhaps conclude that,
while the type of tomb varied in different cases, the most
characteristic, and certainly the most remarkable, type was
that of a stepped or terraced pyramid built of such large
blocks of stone as to merit the name of megalithic monuments.
So far as I have observed in the accounts given
of them, this type of tomb was reserved exclusively for the
sacred chiefs, the Tooitongas, whom the Tongans regarded
as divine and as direct descendants of the gods. The civil
kings, so far as appears, were not buried in these massive
pyramids, but merely in stone vaults sunk in the summits
of grassy mounds.</p>

<p>It is natural, with Sir Basil Thomson,<a name="FNanchor_161_288" id="FNanchor_161_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_288" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> to compare the
pyramids of the Tooitongas with the similar structures called
<i>morais</i> or <i>marais</i> which are found in Tahiti and the Marquesas
islands. Indeed, the very name <i>morai</i> was sometimes applied
to them by the Tongans themselves, though more usually
they called them <i>fiatookas</i>, which was simply the common
word for burying-ground.<a name="FNanchor_162_289" id="FNanchor_162_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_289" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> In Tahiti and the Marquesas
islands these <i>marais</i> were in like manner truncated pyramids,
rising in a series of steps or tiers, built of stones, some of
which were large, but apparently not so large as in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
corresponding Tongan edifices; for in describing one of the
largest of the Tahitian <i>morais</i> or <i>marais</i> Cook mentions only
one stone measuring as much as four feet seven inches in
length by two feet four in breadth, though he found several
three and a half feet long by two and a half feet broad.
These dimensions can hardly compare with the size of the
blocks in the tombs of the Tooitongas, some of which, as
we have seen, measure fifteen, eighteen, and even twenty-two
or twenty-four feet in length by eight or twelve feet in height.
These Tahitian and Marquesan pyramids are commonly
described as temples, and justly so, because the gods were
worshipped there and human sacrifices were offered on
them.<a name="FNanchor_163_290" id="FNanchor_163_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_290" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> But they were also, like the similar structures in
Tonga, used in certain cases for the burial of the dead, or
at all events for the preservation of their embalmed bodies.
Captain Cook seems even to have regarded the Tahitian
<i>morais</i> primarily as burying-grounds and only secondarily
as places of worship.<a name="FNanchor_164_291" id="FNanchor_164_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_291" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> In the island of Huahine, one of the
Society Islands, the sovereign chiefs were buried in a <i>marai</i>,
where they lay, we are told, in more than Oriental state.<a name="FNanchor_165_292" id="FNanchor_165_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_292" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
William Ellis, one of our best authorities on the religion
of the Tahitians, tells us that "the family, district, or royal
<i>maraes</i> were the general depositories of the bones of the
departed, whose bodies had been embalmed, and whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
skulls were sometimes preserved in the dwelling of the
survivors. The <i>marae</i> or temple being sacred, and the
bodies being under the guardianship of the gods, were in
general considered secure when deposited there. This was
not, however, always the case; and in times of war, the
victors sometimes not only despoiled the temples of the
vanquished, and bore away their idol, but robbed the
sacred enclosure of the bones of celebrated individuals."<a name="FNanchor_166_293" id="FNanchor_166_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_293" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
Moerenhout, another good authority on the Tahitian religion,
informs us that the <i>marais</i> which belonged to individuals
often served as cemeteries and were only the more respected
on that account; but he says that in the public <i>marais</i>
almost the only persons buried were the human victims
offered in sacrifice, and sometimes the priests, who were
laid face downwards in the grave, for the curious reason
that otherwise the gaze of the dead men would blight the
trees and cause the fruit to fall to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_167_294" id="FNanchor_167_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_294" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>In the Marquesas islands the <i>morais</i> appear to have
been also used occasionally or even regularly as burial-places.
Langsdorff, one of our earliest authorities on these
islands, speaks of a <i>morai</i> simply as a place of burial.<a name="FNanchor_168_295" id="FNanchor_168_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_295" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> He
tells us that the mummified bodies of the dead were deposited
on scaffolds in the <i>morai</i> or family burial-place, and that the
people of neighbouring but hostile districts used to try to
steal each other's dead from the <i>morais</i>, and deemed it a
great triumph when they succeeded in the attempt. To
defeat such attempts, when the inhabitants of a district
expected to be attacked in force by their enemies, they were
wont to remove their dead from the <i>morai</i> and bury them in
the neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_169_296" id="FNanchor_169_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_296" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Again, in their monograph on the
Marquesas islands, the French writers Vincendon-Dumoulin
and Desgraz recognise only the mortuary aspect of the
<i>morais</i>. They say: "The <i>morais</i>, funeral monuments where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the bodies are deposited, are set up on a platform of stone,
which is the base of all Nukahivan constructions. They are
to be found scattered in the whole extent of the valleys; no
particular condition seems to be required in the choice of
the site. Near the shore of Ta&iuml;ohae is the <i>morai</i> which
contains the remains of a brother of the <i>atepe&iuml;ou Patini</i>, an
uncle of Moana, who died some years ago, as they tell us."<a name="FNanchor_170_297" id="FNanchor_170_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_297" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Thus to some extent, in function as well as in form,
these pyramidical temples of Tahiti and the Marquesas
islands corresponded to the megalithic monuments of the
Tooitongas or sacred chiefs of Tonga; in fact, they were
mausoleums as well as temples. We are not at liberty to
assume, with one authority on the Polynesians, that they
were mausoleums first and foremost, and that they only
developed into temples at a later time.<a name="FNanchor_171_298" id="FNanchor_171_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_298" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> It is possible, on
the contrary, that from the outset they were temples dedicated
to the worship of the high gods, and that the custom of
depositing the dead in them was a later practice adopted for
the sake of the protection which these holy places might be
expected to afford against the efforts of enemies to carry off
and desecrate the remains of the departed. Dr. Rivers
propounded a theory that the custom of building these
megalithic monuments in the form of pyramids was introduced
into the Pacific by a people who brought with them a
secret worship of the sun, and he apparently inclined to
regard the monuments themselves as at least associated
with that worship.<a name="FNanchor_172_299" id="FNanchor_172_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_299" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The theory can hardly apply to the
megalithic monuments of the Tooitongas in Tongataboo;
for the evidence which I have adduced seems to render it
certain that these monuments were erected primarily as
tombs to receive the bodies of the sacred chiefs. It is true
that these tombs enjoyed a sacred character and were the
scene of worship which justly entitles them to rank as
temples; but so far as they were temples, they were devoted
to the worship, not of the sun, but of the dead.</p>

<p>Thus our enquiry into the meaning and origin of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
interesting monuments entirely confirms the view of the
shrewd and observant Captain Cook that the <i>fiatookas</i>, as
the Tongans called them, were both places of burial and
places of worship.</p>

<p>Finally, the evidence which I have cited appears to
render it highly probable that these imposing monuments
were built, not by a prehistoric people, predecessors of the
Tongans in the islands, but by the Tongans themselves; for
not only do the people affirm that the tombs were erected
by their ancestors, but they have definite traditions of some
of the chiefs who built them, and are buried in them; and
they still profess to remember some of the islands from
which the huge stones were brought to Tongataboo in great
double canoes.</p>

<p>That the graves of the great chiefs were, like temples,
regarded by the people with religious reverence appears
plainly from a statement of Mariner. He tells us that a
place called Mafanga, in the western part of Tongataboo,
being a piece of land about half a mile square, was consecrated
ground. "In this spot," he says, "are the graves
where the greatest chiefs from time immemorial have been
buried, and the place is therefore considered sacred; it
would be a sacrilege to fight here, and nobody can be
prevented from landing: if the most inveterate enemies meet
upon this ground, they must look upon each other as friends,
under penalty of the displeasure of the gods, and consequently
an untimely death, or some great misfortune. There
are several of these consecrated places on different islands."<a name="FNanchor_173_300" id="FNanchor_173_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_300" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
Thus the reverence paid to the tombs of the chiefs was like
the reverence paid to the consecrated houses and enclosures
of the gods; we have already seen what a sacrilege it was
deemed to fight or to pursue an enemy within the consecrated
enclosure of a god,<a name="FNanchor_174_301" id="FNanchor_174_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_301" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and we now learn that it was
equally a sacrilege to fight within the ground that was
hallowed by the graves of the chiefs.</p>

<p>Mariner has described for us the worship paid by the
king and his chiefs to one of the sacred graves at Mafanga.
One morning Finow the king, accompanied by several of
his chiefs and their ministers (the <i>matabooles</i>), landed at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Mafanga and immediately proceeded to his father's grave
to perform a ceremony called <i>toogi</i>. Mariner attended the
party and witnessed the ceremony. All who went to participate
in it assumed the attire of mourners or suppliants,
that is, they wore mats instead of their usual dress and they
had wreaths, made of the leaves of the <i>ifi</i> tree, round their
necks. They sat down before the grave, and the king and
all of them beat their cheeks with their fists for about half
a minute without speaking a word. One of the principal
ministers (<i>matabooles</i>) then addressed the spirit of the king's
father to the following effect: "Behold the man (meaning
Finow, the king) who has come to Tonga to fight his
enemies. Be pleased with him, and grant him thy protection.
He comes to battle, hoping he is not doing wrong.
He has always held Tooitonga in the highest respect, and has
attended to all religious ceremonies with exactness." One
of the attendants then went to the king and received from
him a piece of kava root, which he laid down on the raised
mount before the burial-place (<i>fytoka</i>). Several others, who
had pieces of kava root in their bosoms, went up to the
grave in like manner and deposited them there.<a name="FNanchor_175_302" id="FNanchor_175_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_302" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Thus the king prayed to the spirit of his dead father at
his grave and made an offering at the tomb. What more
could he do to a god at his temple? And in general we
are told that when a great blessing was desired, or a serious
evil deprecated, if the people wished to enjoy health or beget
children, to be successful at sea, or victorious in war, they
would go to the burial grounds of their great chiefs, clean
them up thoroughly, sprinkle the floor with sand, and lay
down their offerings.<a name="FNanchor_176_303" id="FNanchor_176_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_303" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> When Finow the king was dying, his
friends carried him on a bier, not only to the temples of
the great gods Tali-y-Toobo and Tooi-fooa-Bolotoo, where
prayers for his recovery were offered; they bore him also to
the grave of a chieftainess and invoked her spirit in like
manner to pity and spare the expiring monarch.<a name="FNanchor_177_304" id="FNanchor_177_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_304" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Apparently
they thought that the ghost of the chieftainess was quite as
able as the great gods to heal the sick and restore the dying.</p>

<p>But on no occasion, perhaps, was the assimilation of dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
men to gods so conspicuous as at the annual offering of
first-fruits, which seems to have been the most impressive of
all the yearly rites observed by the Tongans. The ceremony
was observed once a year just before the yams in general had
arrived at a state of maturity; the yams offered at it were
of a kind which admitted of being planted sooner than the
others, and which consequently, ripening earlier, were the
first-fruits of the yam season. The object of the offering was
to ensure the protection of the gods, that their favour might
be extended to the welfare of the nation generally, and in
particular to the productions of the earth, of which in Tonga
yams are the most important. At this solemn ceremony
the new yams, slung on poles, were brought from distant
islands, carried in procession to the grave of the late Tooitonga,
and deposited in front of it, their bearers sitting down beside
them. Thereupon one of the ministers (<i>matabooles</i>) of the
living Tooitonga arose, advanced, and sat down before the
grave, a little in front of the men who had brought the yams.
Next he addressed the gods generally, and afterwards particularly,
mentioning the late Tooitonga and the names of
several others. In doing so he returned thanks for their
divine bounty in favouring the land with the prospect of
a good harvest, and prayed that their beneficence might
be continued in future. In this harvest thanksgiving the
spirit of the dead Tooitonga seems to have ranked on an
equality with the original or superhuman gods; indeed,
in a sense he took precedence of them, since the offerings
were presented at his grave. The first-fruits, we are told,
were offered to the gods in the person of the divine chief
Tooitonga.<a name="FNanchor_178_305" id="FNanchor_178_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_305" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>On the whole we may conclude that, however sharp a
distinction was drawn in theory between the old gods, who
had always been gods, and the new gods, who had once been
men, the line which divided them in practice was wavering
and blurred. The dead men and women were fast rising, if
they had not already risen, to an equality with the ancient
deities. We may even surmise that some of these old gods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
themselves were human beings, whose original humanity was
forgotten.</p>

<p>The tombs of the kings and sacred chiefs may be described
as megalithic monuments in so far as immense stones
were often employed in the construction either of the enclosing
walls or of the high steps which led up to the summit of
the mound where the grave was dug. It is possible, and
indeed probable, that great stones were similarly employed
as ornaments or accessories of the consecrated houses or
temples of the primary gods, but of such an employment
I have met with no express notice among our authorities.
So far as their descriptions allow us to judge, these megalithic
monuments of the Tongans were purely sepulchral in
character; they were dedicated only to the worship of the
dead. But there exists at least one other remarkable megalithic
monument in these islands of which the original meaning
is quite uncertain, and of which consequently we cannot
confidently say that it was erected for the sake of honouring
or propitiating the spirits of the departed. The monument
in question is situated near the eastern extremity of Tongataboo,
at a distance of three or four hundred yards from the
beach and facing towards the island of Eua. The land on
which it stands was the private property of the Tooitongas,
whose megalithic tombs are situated some eight or nine miles
away to the west. In the intervening country, which is
perfectly flat and partly covered with forest, partly under
cultivation, there are said to be no other monuments or
ruins. It is remarkable that this imposing monument, which
naturally impresses the observer by its resemblance to the
trilithons or gate-like structures of Stonehenge, should have
apparently escaped the observation of Europeans down to
the middle of the nineteenth century. It is not mentioned
by Cook and Mariner, nor even by those who, like the first
missionaries and Dumont d'Urville, described in some detail
the tombs of the Tooitongas not many miles off. Perhaps
the solitariness of the surrounding country may partly account
for their ignorance and silence; for there are said to be few
inhabitants in this part of the island and none at all in the
immediate neighbourhood of the monument. It seems to
have been first discovered by Mr. Philip Hervey of Sydney<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
in 1850 or 1851, but his description of it was not published
for some ten years. In August 1852 it was seen by Dr.
Charles Forbes, Surgeon of H.M.S. <i>Calliope</i>, and his description
of it was published by the Society of Antiquaries of
London in the following year. In 1865 it was seen and
briefly described by Mr. Foljambe of H.M.S. <i>Cura&ccedil;oa</i>. Some
twenty years later the passengers of the s.s. <i>Wairarapa</i>,
on a yachting cruise from New Zealand, visited the spot
and published an account of the structure. Still later Sir
Basil Thomson examined the monument and discussed its
history.<a name="FNanchor_179_306" id="FNanchor_179_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_306" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The monument in question is a structure of the type
known as a trilithon; that is, it is composed of three large
stones, of which two stand upright, while the third rests
horizontally on their tops. All three stones are monoliths
of hardened coral, rough and much weathered on the surface,
and precisely similar to the coral of the neighbouring reefs.
Indeed, about halfway between the monument and the beach
the coral rock is exposed in a hollow, from which it seems
probable that the great blocks were hewn and brought to
their present situation. The statement of Mr. Brenchley, that
the stone of which the monument consists is not to be found
elsewhere on the island, is erroneous. The uprights are
quadrangular monoliths neatly squared. No measurements
of the stones appear to be on record, but the two uprights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
are variously estimated to measure from fourteen to sixteen
feet in height; their breadth or depth from front to back is
variously given as from eight to ten or even twelve feet; but
they seem to taper somewhat upwards, for the estimate which
assigns twelve feet for the depth of the uprights at their
base, mentions seven feet or probably more as their breadth
at the top. The thickness of the uprights seems to be four
feet. The space between them is variously stated at ten
and twelve feet. The cross-stone, which rests on the two
uprights, is reported to measure twenty-four feet in length, by
four or five feet in depth, and two feet in thickness. Each
of the uprights is estimated by Sir Basil Thomson to weigh
not less than fifty tons. The tops of both are deeply mortised
to receive the cross-stone, the ends of which are sunk into
them instead of being laid flat on the top. The cross-stone
lies east and west, so that the opening between the uprights
faces north and south. On the upper surface of the cross-stone,
and at about the middle of it, is a cup-like hollow,
very carefully cut, about the size of a coco-nut shell. A
large bowl of the same material is said to have formerly
stood on the cross-stone, but the statement is not made
by an eyewitness and is probably mistaken.<a name="FNanchor_180_307" id="FNanchor_180_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_307" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The name which the natives give to this megalithic
monument is <i>Haamonga</i> or <i>Ho ha Mo-nga Maui</i>, which is said
to mean "Maui's burden." The name is explained by a
story that the god or hero Maui brought the massive stones
in a gigantic canoe from Uea (Wallis Island), where the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
holes in the rock from which he quarried them may still be
seen. From the canoe he bore them on his back to the
spot where they now stand.<a name="FNanchor_181_308" id="FNanchor_181_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_308" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> This story can hardly be
thought to throw much light on the origin of the monument;
for the natives are in the habit of referring the marvels which
they do not understand to the action of the god or hero
Maui, just as the ancient Greeks fathered many natural
wonders on the deified hero Hercules.<a name="FNanchor_182_309" id="FNanchor_182_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_309" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> But from Mateialona,
Governor of Haapai and cousin of the King of Tonga, Sir
Basil Thomson obtained a tradition of the origin of the
stones which is at least free from the miraculous element and
connects the monument with Tongan history. The account
runs thus: "Concerning the Haamonga of Maui, they say
forsooth that a Tui Tonga (the sacred line of chiefs),
named Tui-ta-tui, erected it, and that he was so named
because it was a time of assassination.<a name="FNanchor_183_310" id="FNanchor_183_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_310" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> And they say that
he had it built for him to sit upon during the Faikava
(ceremony of brewing kava), when the people sat round him
in a circle, and that the king so dreaded assassination that
he had this lordly seat built for himself that he might sit
out of the reach of his people. And this, they say, is the
origin of the present custom of the Faikava, it being now
forbidden for any one to sit behind the king." At such
wassails the presiding chief sits at the apex of an oval. To
this tradition Sir Basil Thomson adds: "Mr. Shirley Baker
told me that he believed the Haamonga to have been erected
as a <i>fakamanatu</i> (memorial) to the son of some Tui Tonga,
a view that finds support in the fondness of Tongan chiefs
for originality in the burial ceremonies of their near relations&mdash;witness
Mariner's account of the funeral of Finau's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
daughter&mdash;but on the other hand native traditions generally have a
kernel of truth, and the legend of Tui-ta-tui and its consequences
finds an analogy in our own custom of guarding against
an assassin's dagger at the drinking of the loving cup."<a name="FNanchor_184_311" id="FNanchor_184_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_311" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
The tradition receives some confirmation from the bowl-like
hollow on the upper surface of the cross-stone; for the hollow
might have served as the king's drinking-cup to hold his
kava at the customary wassails. Indeed, Mr. Philip Hervey,
the first to examine the monument, describes the hollow in
question as "a small cava bowl";<a name="FNanchor_185_312" id="FNanchor_185_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_312" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and after giving an
account of the monument Mr. Brenchley adds: "Its history
seems to be entirely unknown, but it is very natural to
suppose from its form that it was connected with some
ancient kava ceremonies."<a name="FNanchor_186_313" id="FNanchor_186_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_313" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The tradition which connects the erection of the monument
with the reign of a Tooitonga named Tui-ta-tui is
further countenanced, if not confirmed, by a list of the
Tooitongas, in which the name of Tui-ta-tui occurs as the
eleventh in descent from the great god Tangaloa.<a name="FNanchor_187_314" id="FNanchor_187_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_314" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> This
Tui-ta-tui is believed to have reigned in the thirteenth or
fourteenth century of our era.<a name="FNanchor_188_315" id="FNanchor_188_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_315" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> From the size and style of
the masonry Sir Basil Thomson is disposed to assign the
monument to a later date. He points out that for the
quarrying and mortising of stones that weigh some fifty
tons apiece the craft of stone-cutting must have been fully
developed; and from a comparison of the megalithic tombs
of the Tooitongas which can be approximately dated, he
infers that the craft of stone-cutting in Tonga reached its
culmination at the end of the seventeenth century, though
it was still practised down to the beginning of the nineteenth
century; for Mariner tells us that in his time a
professional class of masons was set apart for building the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
stone sepulchral vaults of chiefs.<a name="FNanchor_189_316" id="FNanchor_189_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_316" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Yet on the whole Sir
Basil Thomson concludes that "when one is left to choose
between a definite native tradition on the one hand and
probability on the other for the assignment of a date, I
would prefer the tradition. If the Tongans had invented
the story as a mere expression for antiquity they would not
have pitched upon Tui-ta-tui, about whom nothing else is
recorded, in preference to Takalaua, Kau-ulu-fonua-fekai,
or any of the kings who loom large in traditionary history.
Whether the Haamonga was built for a throne or for a
memorial, doubtless it is connected with the reign of Tui-ta-tui,
who lived in the fourteenth century."<a name="FNanchor_190_317" id="FNanchor_190_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_317" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>As an alternative to the view that the hollow on the
cross-stone was a kava bowl Dr. Rivers suggests that it
"may have been destined to receive the skull and other
bones of the dead, so often preserved in Polynesia."<a name="FNanchor_191_318" id="FNanchor_191_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_318" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The
suggestion accords well with the opinion that the monument
is a memorial of the dead, and it might be supported by the
Samoan practice of severing a dead chief's head from his
body and burying it separately, to save it from being dug
up and desecrated by enemies in time of war.<a name="FNanchor_192_319" id="FNanchor_192_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_319" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> However,
Dr. Rivers is careful to add that such a practice is not
recorded in Tonga and appears to be incompatible with the
mode of sepulture which prevails there.</p>

<p>In this connexion another megalithic monument of the
Tonga islands deserves to be considered, though it appears
to have been commonly overlooked. It was observed by
Captain Cook in the island of Lefooga (Lifuka). He says:
"Near the south end of the island, and on the west side, we
met with an artificial mount. From the size of some trees that
were growing upon it, and from other appearances, I guessed
that it had been raised in remote times. I judged it to be
about forty feet high; and the diameter of its summit
measured fifty feet. At the bottom of this mount stood a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
stone, which must have been hewn out of coral rock. It
was four feet broad, two and a half thick, and fourteen high;
and we were told by the natives present, that not above half
its length appeared above ground. They called it <i>Tangata
Arekee</i>;<a name="FNanchor_193_320" id="FNanchor_193_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_320" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and said, that it had been set up, and the mount
raised, by some of their forefathers, in memory of one of
their kings; but how long since, they could not tell."<a name="FNanchor_194_321" id="FNanchor_194_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_321" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>When we remember that Tongan kings were commonly
buried in such mounds as Captain Cook here describes, and
further that these mounds were commonly enclosed or faced
with great blocks of hewn stone, we may be disposed to
accept as reasonable and probable the explanation which
the natives gave of this great monolith, which, if the reported
measurements of it are correct, must have been no less than
twenty-eight feet high. If it was indeed a memorial of a
dead king, it might be thought to strengthen the view that
the great trilithon was also set up as a monument to a
deceased monarch or Tooitonga.</p>

<p>Another possible explanation of the trilithon is, as Sir
Basil Thomson points out, that it served as a gateway to
some sacred spot inland. But against this view he observes
that he examined the bush for some distance in the neighbourhood
without finding any trace of ruins or stones of any
kind. He adds that the memory of sacred spots dies very
hard in Tonga, and that the natives do not believe the
trilithon to have been a gateway.<a name="FNanchor_195_322" id="FNanchor_195_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_322" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>It is natural to compare the trilithon of Tongataboo
with the famous trilithons of Stonehenge, which it resembles
in plan and to which it is comparable in size. The resemblance
struck Dr. Charles Forbes, the first to publish a
description of the monument based on personal observation.
He says: "The route we pursued led us over a country
perfectly level, with the exception of occasional mounds of
earth, apparently artificial, and reminding one very much of
the barrows of Wilts and Dorset, which idea is still more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
strongly impressed upon the mind on coming in sight of the
monument, which bears a most striking resemblance to the
larger gateway-looking stones at Stonehenge."<a name="FNanchor_196_323" id="FNanchor_196_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_323" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> But at the
same time, as Dr. Forbes did not fail to note, the Tongan
trilithon differs in some respects from those of Stonehenge.
In the first place the interval (ten or twelve feet) between
the uprights of the Tongan trilithon appears to be much
greater than the interval between the uprights of the trilithons
at Stonehenge.<a name="FNanchor_197_324" id="FNanchor_197_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_324" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> In the second place, the cross-stone of the
Tongan trilithon is mortised much more deeply into the
uprights than are the cross-stones at Stonehenge. For
whereas at Stonehenge these cross-stones present the appearance
of being laid flat on the top of the uprights, the cross-stone
of the Tongan trilithon is sunk deeply into the uprights
by means of mortises or grooves about two feet wide
which are cut into the uprights, so that the top of the cross-stone
is nearly flush with their tops, while its ends also are
nearly flush with their outside surfaces.<a name="FNanchor_198_325" id="FNanchor_198_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_325" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>As the origin and purpose of Stonehenge are still
unknown, its massive trilithons can hardly be cited to
explain the similar monument of Tongataboo. The rival
theories which see in Stonehenge a memorial of the dead
and a temple of the sun<a name="FNanchor_199_326" id="FNanchor_199_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_326" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> are equally applicable or inapplicable
to the Tongan monument. In favour of the
mortuary character of this solitary trilithon it might be
urged that the Tongans were long accustomed to erect
megalithic monuments, though of a different type, at the
tombs of their sacred kings, which are situated not many
miles away; but against this view it may be argued that
there are no traces of burial or graves in the immediate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
neighbourhood, and that native tradition, not lightly to be
set aside, assigns a different origin to the monument.
Against the solar interpretation of the trilithon it may be
alleged, first, that the monument faces north and south,
not east and west, as it might be expected to do if it were
a temple of the sun or a gateway leading into such a
temple; second, that, while a circle of trilithons, as at
Stonehenge, with an opening towards the sunrise may be
plausibly interpreted as a temple of the sun, such an
interpretation cannot so readily be applied to a solitary
trilithon facing north and south; and, third, that no trace
of sun-worship has been discovered in the Tonga islands.
So far as I have observed, the Tongan pantheon is nowhere
said to have included a sun-god, and the Tongans are
nowhere reported to have paid any special respect to the
sun. Savages in general, it may be added, appear to be
very little addicted to sun-worship; it is for the most
part among peoples at a much higher level of culture, such
as the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, and Peruvians, that
solar worship becomes an important, or even the predominant,
feature of the national faith.<a name="FNanchor_200_327" id="FNanchor_200_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_327" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Perhaps the
impulse to it came rather from the meditations of priestly
astronomers than from the random fancies of common men.
Some depth of thought was needed to detect in the sun
the source of all life on earth; the immutable regularity
of the great luminary's movements failed to rouse the
interest or to excite the fear of the savage, to whom the
elements of the unusual, the uncertain, and the terrible
are the principal incentives to wonder and awe, and hence
to reflexion. We are all naturally more impressed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
extraordinary than by ordinary events; the fine edge of
the mind is dulled by familiarity in the one case and
whetted by curiosity in the other.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the numerous other stone monuments
scattered widely over the islands of the Pacific, from the
Carolines to Easter Island, Dr. Guillemard concludes that
some race, with a different, if not a higher civilisation
preceded the Polynesian race in its present homes, and to
this earlier race he would apparently refer the erection of
the trilithon in Tongataboo.<a name="FNanchor_201_328" id="FNanchor_201_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_328" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> He may be right. Yet
when we consider, first, the native tradition of the setting
up of the trilithon by one of the sacred kings of Tonga;
second, the practice of the Tongans of building megalithic
tombs for these same sacred kings; and, third, the former
existence in Tonga of a professional class of masons whose
business it was to construct stone vaults for the burial of
chiefs,<a name="FNanchor_202_329" id="FNanchor_202_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_329" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> we may hesitate to resort to the hypothesis of an
unknown people in order to explain the origin of a
monument which the Tongans, as we know them, appear
to have been quite capable of building for themselves.</p>


<h4>&sect; 11. <i>Rites of Burial and Mourning</i></h4>

<p>The only mode of disposing of the dead which was
practised in the Tonga islands seems to have been burial
in the earth. So far as appears, the corpse was not doubled
up, but laid at full length in the grave; at all events I
have met with no mention of burying a corpse in a contracted
posture; and Captain Cook says that "when a
person dies, he is buried, after being wrapped up in mats
and cloth, much after our manner." He adds that, while
chiefs had the special burial-places called <i>fiatookas</i> appropriated
to their use, common people were interred in no
particular spot.<a name="FNanchor_203_330" id="FNanchor_203_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_330" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> So far as I have observed, none of our
authorities speak of a practice of embalming the dead or
of giving the bodies any particular direction in the grave.</p>

<p>After a death the mourners testified their sorrow by
dressing in old ragged mats and wearing green leaves of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the <i>ifi</i> tree round their necks. Thus attired they would
repair to the tomb, where, on entering the enclosure, they
would pull off the green twigs from their necks and throw
them away; then sitting down they would solemnly
drink kava.<a name="FNanchor_204_331" id="FNanchor_204_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_331" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Further, they accompanied their cries and
ejaculations of grief and despair by inflicting on their own
bodies many grievous wounds and injuries. They burned
circles and scars on their bodies, beat their teeth with
stones, struck shark's teeth into their heads till the blood
flowed in streams, and thrust spears into the inner part
of the thigh, into their sides below the arm-pits, and
through the cheeks into the mouth.<a name="FNanchor_205_332" id="FNanchor_205_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_332" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Women in wailing
would cut off their fingers, and slit their noses, their ears,
and their cheeks.<a name="FNanchor_206_333" id="FNanchor_206_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_333" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> At the funerals of the kings especially
the mourners indulged in frantic excesses of self-torture
and mutilation. Of two such funerals we have the detailed
descriptions of eye-witnesses who resided in the islands at
a time when the natives were as yet practically unaffected
by European influence. King Moom&#333;oe died in April
1797, and the first missionaries to Tonga witnessed and
described his funeral. They have told how, when the
corpse was being carried in procession to a temporary house
near the royal burial-ground (<i>fiatooka</i>), it was preceded by
relatives of the deceased in the usual mourning garb, who
cut their heads with shark's teeth till the blood streamed
down their faces. A few days later, when the burial was
to take place, the missionaries found about four thousand
people assembled at the mound where the body was to be
interred. In a few minutes they heard a great shouting
and blowing of conch-shells, and soon after there appeared
about a hundred men, armed with clubs and spears, who,
rushing into the area, began to cut and mangle themselves
in a most dreadful manner. Many struck their heads such
violent blows with their clubs that the sound could be
heard thirty or forty yards off, and they repeated them till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the blood ran down in streams. Others, who had spears,
thrust them through their thighs, arms, and cheeks, all the
while calling on the deceased in a most affecting manner.
A native of Fiji, who had been a servant of the late king,
appeared quite frantic; he entered the area with fire in his
hand, and having previously oiled his hair, he set it ablaze,
and ran about with it all on flame. When they had
satisfied or exhausted themselves with this manner of
torment, they sat down, beat their faces with their fists,
and then retired. A second party then inflicted on themselves
the same cruelties. A third party next entered,
shouting and blowing shells; four of the foremost held
stones, which they used to knock out their teeth, while
those who blew the shells employed them as knives with
which they hacked their heads in a shocking manner.
A man who had a spear pierced his arm with it just above
the elbow, and with it sticking fast in his flesh ran about
the area for some time. Another, who seemed to be a
principal chief, acted as if quite bereft of his senses; he
ran to every corner of the area, and at each station beat
his head with a club till the blood flowed down on his
shoulders. At this point the missionary, unable to bear the
sight of these self-inflicted tortures, quitted the scene.
When his colleagues visited the place some hours later in
the afternoon, they found the natives of both sexes still at
the dreadful work of cutting and mangling themselves.
In the course of these proceedings a party of mourners
entered the area, sixteen of whom had recently cut off
their little fingers. They were followed by another party
with clubs and spears, who battered and wounded themselves
in the usual fashion, and also disfigured their faces with
coco-nut husks, which they had fastened to the knuckles
of both hands. The missionaries noticed that the mourners
who were either related to the dead king or had held office
under him, were the most cruel to themselves; some of
them thrust two, three, and even four spears into their
arms, and so danced round the area, while others broke
off the spear-heads in their flesh.<a name="FNanchor_207_334" id="FNanchor_207_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_334" class="fnanchor">[207]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar scenes were witnessed some years later by
Mariner at the death and burial of Finow, another king of
Tonga; and the Englishman has described from personal
observation how on this occasion the mourners cut and
wounded their heads and bodies with clubs, stones, knives,
or sharp shells. This they did on one or other of the
<i>malais</i><a name="FNanchor_208_335" id="FNanchor_208_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_335" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> or ceremonial grounds in the presence of many
spectators, vying apparently with each other in the effort
to surpass the rest in this public manifestation of their
sorrow for the death of the king and their respect for his
memory. As one ran out into the middle of the ground he
would cry, "Finow! I know well your mind; you have
departed to Bolotoo, and left your people under suspicion that
I, or some of those about you, were unfaithful; but where
is the proof of infidelity? where is a single instance of
disrespect?" Then, inflicting violent blows and deep cuts
on his head with a club, stone, or knife, he would again
exclaim at intervals, "Is this not a proof of my fidelity? does
this not evince loyalty and attachment to the memory of the
departed warrior?" Some more violent than others cut
their heads to the skull with such heavy and repeated blows
that they reeled and lost their reason for a time.<a name="FNanchor_209_336" id="FNanchor_209_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_336" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The
king's successor, Finow the Second, not content with the
usual instruments of torture, employed a saw for the purpose,
striking his skull with the teeth so violently that he
staggered for loss of blood; but this he did, not at the time
of the burial and in presence of the multitude, but some
weeks later at a more private ceremony of mourning before
the grave.<a name="FNanchor_210_337" id="FNanchor_210_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_337" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> At the public ceremony the late king's fishermen
varied the usual breaking of heads and slashing of
bodies by a peculiar form of self-torment. Instead of clubs
they appropriately carried the paddles of canoes, with which
they battered their heads in the orthodox style; but besides
every man of them had three arrows stuck through each
cheek in a slanting direction, so that, while the points
pierced through the cheeks into the mouth, the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
ends went over the shoulder and were kept in position by
another arrow, the point of which was tied to the ends of the
arrows passing over one shoulder, while the other end was
tied to the ends of the other arrows which passed over the
other shoulder. Thus each fisherman was decorated with a
triangle of arrows, of which the apex consisted of six arrow-heads
in his mouth, while the base dangled on his back.
With this remarkable equipment they walked round the
grave, beating their faces and heads with their paddles, or
pinching up the skin of the breast and sticking a spear right
through it.<a name="FNanchor_211_338" id="FNanchor_211_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_338" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The grave of a chief's family was a vault paved with a
single large stone, while the four walls were formed each of
a single block. The vault was about eight feet long, six
feet broad, and eight feet deep, and was covered at the top
by one large stone.<a name="FNanchor_212_339" id="FNanchor_212_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_339" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> So heavy was this covering stone that,
as we have seen, from a hundred and fifty to two hundred
men were required to lift and lower it.<a name="FNanchor_213_340" id="FNanchor_213_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_340" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Mariner estimated
that the family vault in which King Finow was interred was
large enough to hold thirty bodies. When the king's corpse
was being deposited in it, Mariner saw two dry and perfectly
preserved bodies lying in the vault, together with the bones
of several others; and he was told by old men that the well-preserved
bodies had been buried when they, his informants,
were boys, which must have been upwards of forty years
before; whereas the bodies of which nothing but the bones
remained had been buried later. The natives attributed
the exceptional preservation of the two to the better constitution
of their former owners; Mariner, or more probably
his editor, Dr. Martin, preferred to suppose that the
difference was due to the kind or duration of the disease
which had carried them off. Apparently the natives did
not suggest that the bodies had been embalmed, which they
would almost certainly have done if they had known of such
a custom.<a name="FNanchor_214_341" id="FNanchor_214_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_341" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> No sooner was the king's body deposited in
the grave, and the great stone lowered over it, than certain
ministers (<i>matabooles</i>) and warriors ran like men frantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
round and round the burial-ground, exclaiming, "Alas! how
great is our loss! Finow! you are departed; witness this
proof of our love and loyalty!" At the same time they cut
and bruised their own heads with clubs, knives, and axes in
the usual fashion.<a name="FNanchor_215_342" id="FNanchor_215_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_342" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Afterwards the grave was filled up with
earth and strewed with sand, which a company of women
and men had brought for the purpose in baskets from a
place at the back of the island; what remained of the sand
was scattered over the sepulchral mound (<i>fytoca</i>), of which
it was deemed a great embellishment. The inside of the
burial-ground was then spread with mats made of coco-nut
leaves.<a name="FNanchor_216_343" id="FNanchor_216_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_343" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Meantime the company of mourners had been seated on
the green before the burial-ground, still wearing their mourning
garb of mats, with leaves of the <i>ifi</i> tree strung round
their necks. They now arose and went to their homes,
where they shaved their heads and burnt their cheeks with
a lighted roll of bark-cloth, by applying it once upon each
cheek-bone; next they rubbed the place with an astringent
berry, which caused it to bleed, and afterwards they smeared
the blood in a broad circle round the wound, giving themselves
a very ghastly appearance. They repeated this friction with
the berry every day, making the wound bleed afresh; and
the men meanwhile neglected to shave and to oil themselves
during the day, though they indulged in these comforts at
night. Having burnt their cheeks and shaved their heads,
they built for themselves small temporary huts, where they
lived during the time of mourning, which lasted twenty
days.<a name="FNanchor_217_344" id="FNanchor_217_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_344" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The women who had become tabooed, that is, in a state
of ceremonial pollution, by touching the king's dead body,
remained constantly within the burial-ground for the twenty
days of mourning, except when they retired to one of the
temporary huts to eat,<a name="FNanchor_218_345" id="FNanchor_218_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_345" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> or rather to be fed by others. For
it was a rule that no ordinary person, man or woman, could
touch a dead chief without being tabooed, that is ceremonially
polluted, for ten lunar months, during which time he or
she might not touch food with their own hands. But for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
chiefs the period of pollution was limited to three, four, or
five months, according to the superiority of the dead chief.
Only when the dead body which they had touched was that
of the sacred chief, the Tooitonga, they were all tabooed for
ten months, however high their rank; for example, the king's
wife was tabooed for that length of time during the residence
of Mariner, because she had touched the dead body of the
Tooitonga. During the time that a person was tabooed, he
might not feed himself with his own hands, but must be
fed by somebody else: he might not even use a toothpick
himself, but might guide another person's hand holding the
toothpick. If he was hungry and had no one to feed him,
he must go down on his hands and knees, and pick up his
victuals with his mouth; and if he infringed any of these
rules, it was firmly expected that he would swell up and die.<a name="FNanchor_219_346" id="FNanchor_219_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_346" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
Captain Cook observed this custom in operation at Tongataboo.
On one of his walks he met with a party of women at
supper, and noticed that two of them were being fed by others.
On asking the reason, he was answered <i>taboo mattee</i>, that is,
"Death taboo." It was explained to him that one of the
women had washed the dead body of a chief two months
before, and that consequently she might not handle any food
for five months. The other had performed the same office
for the corpse of another person of inferior rank, and was
now under the same restriction, but not for so long a time.<a name="FNanchor_220_347" id="FNanchor_220_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_347" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
The tabooed women at Finow's grave were supplied with
food by the new king, Finow the Second. The food was
brought and placed on the ground at some distance from the
grave, or else it was deposited before the temporary house
to which the chief of the tabooed women retired to be fed.
With the provisions was also sent every day a supply of
torches to light up the burial-ground by night. The torches
were held up by a woman of inferior rank, who, when she
was tired, was relieved in her office by another. During the
twenty days of mourning, if any one passed the burial-ground,
he had to go at a slow pace, with his head bowed down, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
his hands clasped before him; and if he carried a burden,
he must lower it from his shoulder and carry it in his hands
or on his bended arms; but if he could not do so conveniently,
he had to make a circuit to avoid the grave.</p>

<p>Such were the regular observances at the death and
burial of chiefs; they were not peculiar to the obsequies of
Finow the king.<a name="FNanchor_221_348" id="FNanchor_221_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_348" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>The twentieth day of mourning concluded the ceremonies
in honour of the deceased monarch. Early in the morning
all his relations, together with the members of his household,
and also the women who were tabooed on account of having
touched his dead body in the process of oiling and preparing
it, went to the back of the island to procure a quantity of
flat pebbles, principally white, but a few black, which they
brought back in baskets to the grave. There they strewed
the inside of the house and the outside of the burial-ground
(<i>fytoca</i>) with the white pebbles as a decoration; the black
pebbles they laid only on the top of those white ones which
covered the ground directly over the body, to about the
length and breadth of a man, in the form of a very eccentric
ellipse. After that, the house on the burial mound was
closed up at both ends with a reed fencing, which reached
from the eaves to the ground; while at the front and the
back the house was closed with a sort of basket-work, made
of the young branches of the coco-nut tree, split and interwoven
in a very curious and ornamental way. These fences
were to remain until the next burial, when they would be
taken down and, after the conclusion of the ceremony, replaced
by new ones of similar pattern. A large quantity
of food and kava was now sent by the chiefs and the king
to the public place (<i>malai</i>) in front of the burial mound, and
these provisions were served out among the people in the
usual way. The company then separated and repaired to
their respective houses, to prepare for the dances and the
grand wrestling-match, which were to conclude the funeral
rites.<a name="FNanchor_222_349" id="FNanchor_222_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_349" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>During the intervals of the dances, which followed, several
warriors and ministers (<i>matabooles</i>) ran before the grave,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
cutting and bruising their heads with axes, clubs, and so
forth as proofs of fidelity to their late chief, the dead
and buried King Finow. It was on this occasion that the
deceased king's fishermen demonstrated their loyalty and
attachment to his memory by the self-inflicted tortures which
I have already described.<a name="FNanchor_223_350" id="FNanchor_223_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_350" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> When these exhibitions of cruelty
were over, the day's ceremonies, which altogether lasted about
six hours, were terminated by a grand wrestling-match.
That being over, the people dispersed to their respective
houses or occupations, and the obsequies of Finow, king of
the Tonga islands, came to an end.<a name="FNanchor_224_351" id="FNanchor_224_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_351" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The wrestling-match which wound up the funeral honours
paid to the departed monarch would seem not to have been
an isolated case of athletic sports held at this particular
funeral. Apparently it was a general custom in Tonga to
conclude burial-rites with games of this kind. At least we
may infer as much from an expression made use of by the
first missionaries to Tongataboo. They say that the chief
of their district, after taking to himself a wife in the morning
went in the afternoon "to finish the funeral ceremonies for
his brother, in celebrating the games usual on that occasion."<a name="FNanchor_225_352" id="FNanchor_225_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_352" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
The practice, which is apt to seem to us incongruous, of
holding games at a funeral, was observed by the Greeks
in antiquity and by not a few other peoples in modern
times.<a name="FNanchor_226_353" id="FNanchor_226_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_353" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand the obsequies of the sacred or divine
chief, the Tooitonga, differed in certain remarkable particulars
from the posthumous honours generally paid to chiefs.
It is true that his burial-place was of the same form as that
of other chiefs, and that the mode of his interment did not
differ essentially from theirs, except that it was customary to
deposit some of his most valuable property with him in the
grave, including his beads, whale's teeth, fine Samoan mats,
and other articles. Hence the family burying-place of the
Tooitongas in the island of Tongataboo, where the whole line
of these pontiffs had been interred, must have become very rich
in the course of time; for no native would dare to commit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the sacrilege of stealing the treasures at the holy tomb.<a name="FNanchor_227_354" id="FNanchor_227_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_354" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
However, the sacrifice of property to the dead seems not
to have been, as Mariner supposed, peculiar to the funeral
of the Tooitonga; for at the burial of King Moom&#333;oe, in
May 1797, the first missionaries saw files of women and
men bringing bags of valuable articles, fine mats, and bales
of cloth, which they deposited in the tomb expressly as a
present for the dead.<a name="FNanchor_228_355" id="FNanchor_228_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_355" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Again, the mourning costume worn
for the Tooitonga was the same as that for any chief, consisting
of ragged old mats on the body and leaves of the
<i>ifi</i> tree round the neck; but in the case of the Tooitonga the
time of mourning was extended to four months, the mats
being generally left off after three months, while the leaves
were still retained for another month; and the female
mourners remained within the burial-ground (<i>fytoca, fiatooka</i>)
for about two months, instead of twenty days, only retiring
occasionally to temporary houses in the neighbourhood to
eat or for other necessary purposes.<a name="FNanchor_229_356" id="FNanchor_229_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_356" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>One very remarkable peculiarity in the mourning for a
Tooitonga was that, though he ranked above the king and
all other chiefs, the mourners strictly abstained from manifesting
their grief by wounding their heads and cutting
their bodies in the manner that was customary at the funerals
of all other great men. Mariner was never able to learn
the reason for this abstention.<a name="FNanchor_230_357" id="FNanchor_230_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_357" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Other peculiar features in the obsequies of a Tooitonga
were the following. In the afternoon of the day of burial,
when the body of the Tooitonga was already within the
burial-ground, almost every man, woman, and child, all
dressed in the usual mourning garb, and all provided with
torches, used to sit down about eighty yards from the grave;
in the course of an hour a multitude of several thousands
would thus assemble. One of the female mourners would
then come forth from the burial-ground and call out to the
people, saying, "Arise ye, and approach"; whereupon the
people would get up, and advancing about forty yards would
again sit down. Two men behind the grave now began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
blow conch-shells, and six others, with large lighted torches,
about six feet high, advanced from behind the burial-ground,
descended the mound, and walked in single file several times
between the burial-ground and the people, waving their
flaming torches in the air. After that they began to ascend
the mound, whereupon all the people rose up together and
made a loud crashing noise by snapping their <i>bolatas</i>, which
were pieces of the stem of a banana tree used to receive the
ashes falling from lighted torches. Having done so, the
people followed the torch-bearers in single file up the mound
and walked in procession round about the tomb (<i>fytoca</i>).
As they passed at the back of the tomb, they all, torch-bearers
and people, deposited their extinguished torches on
the ground; while the female mourners within thanked them
for providing these things. Having thus marched round, the
people returned to their places and sat down. Thereupon
the master of the ceremonies came forward and ordered them
to divide themselves into parties according to their districts;
which being done he assigned to one party the duty of
clearing away the bushes and grass from one side of the
grave, and to another party a similar task in regard to
another side of the grave, while a third party was charged
to remove rubbish, and so forth. In this way the whole
neighbourhood of the burial-ground was soon cleared, and
when this was done, all the people returned to the temporary
houses which, as mourners, they were bound to occupy.<a name="FNanchor_231_358" id="FNanchor_231_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_358" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Soon after darkness had fallen, certain persons stationed
at the grave began again to sound the conches, while others
chanted a song, or rather recitative, partly in the Samoan
dialect, partly in an unknown language, of which the natives
could give no account. None of them understood the
words, nor could they explain how their forefathers came to
learn them. All that they knew was that the words had
been handed down from father to son among the class of
people whose business it was to direct burial ceremonies.
According to Mariner, some of the words were Tongan, and
he thought that the language was probably an old or corrupt
form of Tongan, though he could make no sense out of it.
Such traditional repetition of a litany in an unknown tongue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
is not uncommon among savages; it occurs, for instance,
very frequently among some of the aboriginal tribes of
Australia, where the chants or recitatives accompanying
certain dances or ceremonies are often passed on from one
tribe to another, the members of which perform the borrowed
dance or ceremony and repeat by rote the borrowed chants
or recitatives without understanding a word of them.<a name="FNanchor_232_359" id="FNanchor_232_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_359" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>While the conches were sounding and the voices of the
singers broke the silence of night, about sixty men assembled
before the grave, where they awaited further orders. When
the chanting was over, and the notes of the conches had
ceased to sound, one of the women mourners came forward,
and sitting down outside the graveyard addressed the men
thus: "Men! ye are gathered here to perform the duty imposed
on you; bear up, and let not your exertions be wanting
to accomplish the work." With these words she retired into
the burial-ground. The men now approached the mound in
the dark, and, in the words of Mariner, or his editor, performed
their devotions to Cloacina, after which they withdrew.
As soon as it was daylight the next morning, the
women of the first rank, wives and daughters of the greatest
chiefs, assembled with their female attendants, bringing
baskets and shells wherewith to clear up the deposit of the
preceding night; and in this ceremonious act of humility no
lady of the highest rank refused to take her part. Some of
the mourners in the burial-ground generally came out to
assist, so that in a very little while the place was made
perfectly clean. This deposit was repeated the fourteen
following nights, and as punctually cleared away by sunrise
every morning. No persons but the agents were allowed to
be witnesses of these extraordinary ceremonies; at least it
would have been considered highly indecorous and irreligious
to pry upon them. On the sixteenth day, early in the
morning, the same women again assembled, but now they
were dressed in the finest bark-cloth and beautiful Samoan
mats, decorated with ribbons and with wreaths of flowers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
round their necks; they also brought new baskets, ornamented
with flowers, and little brooms very tastefully made.
Thus equipped, they approached and acted as if they had
the same task to perform as before, pretending to clear up
the dirt, and to take it away in their baskets, though there
was no dirt to remove. Then they returned to the capital
and resumed their mourning dress of mats and leaves. Such
were the rites performed during the fifteen days; every day
the ceremony of the burning torches was also repeated.<a name="FNanchor_233_360" id="FNanchor_233_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_360" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>For one month from the day of burial, greater or
less quantities of provisions were brought every day and
shared out to the people. On the first day the quantity
supplied was prodigious; but day by day the supply gradually
diminished till on the last day it was reduced to very
little.<a name="FNanchor_234_361" id="FNanchor_234_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_361" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Nevertheless the consumption or waste of food on
such occasions was so great that to guard against a future
dearth of provisions it was deemed necessary to lay a prohibition
or taboo on the eating of hogs, fowls, and coco-nuts
for a period of eight or ten months, though two or three
plantations were exempted from this rigorous embargo, to
the end that in the meantime hogs, fowls, and coco-nuts
might be furnished for occasional religious rites, and that the
higher order of chiefs might be able to partake of these
victuals. At the end of the eight or ten months' fast the
taboo was removed and permission to eat of the forbidden
foods was granted by the king at a solemn ceremony.
Immense quantities of yams having been collected and piled
up in columns, and some three or four hundred hogs having
been killed, the people assembled from all quarters at the
king's <i>mal&aacute;i</i> or public place. Of the slaughtered hogs about
twenty were deposited, along with a large quantity of yams,
at the grave of the deceased Tooitonga. The rest of the
provisions were shared out in definite proportions among the
gods, the king, the divine chief (the living Tooitonga), the
inferior chiefs, and the people, so that every man in the
island of Tongataboo got at least a mouthful of pork and
yam. The ceremony concluded with dancing, wrestling, and
other sports, after which every person retired to his home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
with his portion of food to share it with his family. The
hogs and yams deposited at the dead Tooitonga's grave
were left lying till the pork stank and the yams were rotten,
whereupon the living Tooitonga ordered that they should be
distributed to all who chose to apply for a portion. In
strict law they belonged to the principal chiefs, but as these
persons were accustomed to feed on meat in a rather less
advanced stage of decomposition they kindly waived their
claims to the putrid pork and rotten yams in favour of the
lower orders, who were less nice in their eating.<a name="FNanchor_235_362" id="FNanchor_235_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_362" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>It was customary that the chief widow of the Tooitonga
should be strangled and interred with his dead body.<a name="FNanchor_236_363" id="FNanchor_236_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_363" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> But
the practice of strangling a wife at her husband's funeral
was not limited to the widows of the Tooitongas. A similar
sacrifice seems to have been formerly offered at the obsequies
of a king; for at the funeral of King Moom&ouml;oe the first
missionaries to Tonga saw two of the king's widows being
led away to be strangled.<a name="FNanchor_237_364" id="FNanchor_237_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_364" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The funeral and mourning customs which we have
passed in review serve to illustrate the Tongan conceptions
of the soul and of its survival after death. The strangling of
widows was probably intended here as elsewhere to despatch
their spirits to attend their dead husbands in the spirit
land;<a name="FNanchor_238_365" id="FNanchor_238_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_365" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and the deposition of valuable property in the grave
can hardly have had, at least in origin, any other object
than to ensure the comfort of the departed in the other
world, and incidentally, perhaps, to remove from him any
temptation to return to his sorrowing friends in this world
for the purpose of recovering the missing articles. The
self-inflicted wounds and bruises of the mourners were
clearly intended to impress the ghost with the sincerity of
their regret at his departure from this sublunary scene; if
any doubt could linger in our minds as to the intention of
these extravagant proceedings, it would be set at rest by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
words with which, as we have seen, the mourners accompanied
them, calling on the dead man to witness their
voluntary tortures and to judge for himself of the genuineness
of their sorrow. In this connexion it is to be borne in mind
that all dead noblemen, in the opinion of the Tongans, were
at once promoted to the rank of deities; so that it was in
their power to visit any disrespect to their memory and any
defalcation of their dues with the double terror of ghosts
and of gods. No wonder that the Tongans sought to keep on
good terms with such mighty beings by simulating, when
they did not feel, a sense of the irreparable loss which the
world had sustained by their dissolution.</p>


<h4>&sect; 12. <i>The Ethical Influence of Tongan Religion</i></h4>

<p>Surveyed as a whole, the Tongan religion presents
a singular instance of a creed which restricted the hope of
immortality to the nobly born and denied it to commoners.
According to the doctrine which it inculcated, the aristocratic
pre-eminence accorded to chiefs in this world was more
than maintained by them in the next, where they enjoyed
a monopoly of immortality. And not content with sojourning
in the blissful regions of Bolotoo, their departed spirits
often returned to earth to warn, to direct, to threaten
their people, either in dreams and visions of the night, or
by the mouth of the priests whom they inspired. Such
beliefs involved in theory and to some extent in practice
a subjection of the living to the dead, of the seen and
temporal to the unseen and eternal. In favour of the
creed it may at least be alleged that, while it looked to
spiritual powers, whether ghosts or gods, for the reward of
virtue and the punishment of vice, it did not appeal to
another life to redress the balance of justice which had been
disturbed in this one. The Tongan religion inculcated a
belief that the good and the bad alike receive a recompense
here on earth, thus implicitly repudiating the unworthy
notion that men can only be lured or driven into the narrow
way of righteousness by the hope of heaven or the fear of
hell. So far the creed based morality on surer foundations
than any faith which would rest the ultimate sanctions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
conduct on the slippery ground of posthumous rewards and
punishments. In this respect, if in no other, we may
compare the Tongan religion to that of the Hebrew
prophets. It has been rightly observed by Renan that
whereas European races in general have found in the
assurance of a life to come ample compensation for the
iniquities of this present life, the Hebrew prophets never
appeal to rewards and punishments reserved for a future
state of existence. They were not content with the conception
of a lame and laggard justice that limps far behind
the sinner in this world and only overtakes him in the
next. According to them, God's justice is swift and sure
here on earth; an unjust world was in their eyes a simple
monstrosity.<a name="FNanchor_239_366" id="FNanchor_239_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_366" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> So too, apparently, thought the Tongans,
and some Europeans may be inclined to agree with them.</p>

missionary, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Grange (<i>Annales de

pp. 15 <i>sqq.</i>), and though he writes
with a manifest prejudice against his
rivals the Protestant missionaries, his
evidence is confirmed by Commodore
Wilkes, the commander of the United
States Exploring Expedition, who on
his visit to Tongataboo found the
Christians and heathens about to go
to war with each other. He attempted
to make peace between them, but in
vain. The heathen were ready to
accept his overtures, but "it was
evident that King George and his
advisers, and, indeed, the whole
Christian party, seemed to be desirous
of continuing the war, either to force
the heathen to become Christians, or to
carry it on to extermination, which the
number of their warriors made them
believe they had the power to effect.
I felt, in addition, that the missionaries
were thwarting my exertions by permitting
warlike preparations during
the pending of the negotiations."

United States Exploring Expedition</i>,

Charles Wilkes, <i>Narrative of the United

"Hikuleo is the god of spirits, and is
the third in order of time; he dwells
in a cave in the island. Bulotu is
most remarkable for a long tail, which
prevents him from going farther from
the cave in which he resides than its
length will admit of." Here the god
Hikuleo appears to be confused with
the island of Bulotu (Bulotoo) in which
he resided. Tradition wavers on the
question whether Hikuleo was a god
or goddess, "but the general suffrage
seems in favour of the female sex."

to Mariner the number of the
original gods was about three hundred;
but as to the deified noblemen he merely
says that "of these there must be a
vast number" (<i>Tonga Islands</i>, ii. 109).
In his "Notes on Tongan Religion"
(<i>Journal of the Polynesian Society</i>,
xxx. (1921) p. 159) Mr. E. E. V.
Collocot remarks: "The number
of the gods, moreover, was liable
to constant augmentation by the deification
of the illustrious or well-beloved
dead." As a notable instance he
cites the case of a certain chief named
Fakailoatonga, a native of Vavau, who
subdued or overran a large part of
Tongataboo. He was a leper, but for
a long time did not know the true
nature of his malady. When he
learned the truth, he in disgust buried
himself alive, and after his death he
was elevated to the godhead. But in
this deification, if Mariner is right,
there was nothing exceptional; as a
chief he became a god after death in
the course of nature.</p></div>

p. 252. As to Futtaf&#257;ihe, the Tooitonga
or divine chief of their time,
the missionaries remark (<i>l.c.</i>) that
"Futtaf&#257;ihe is very superstitious, and
himself esteemed as an <i>odooa</i> or god."
Here <i>odooa</i> is the Polynesian word
which is usually spelled <i>atua</i>. Mariner
tells us (<i>Tonga Islands</i>, ii. 76) that the
family name of the Tooitonga was
Fatafehi, which seems to be only
another way of spelling Futtaf&#257;ihe, the
form adopted by the missionaries.
Captain Cook similarly gives Futtaf&#257;ihe
as the family name of the sacred kings
or Tooitongas, deriving the name
"from the God so called, who is
probably their tutelary patron, and
perhaps their common ancestor." See
Captain James Cook, <i>Voyages</i>, v. 425.</p></div>

accompanied by an engraved plate,
which illustrates the three types of
tombs mentioned in the text. In the
foreground is the stepped pyramid, a
massive and lofty structure, its flat top
surmounted by a hut. To the right,
in the distance, is seen the square
walled enclosure, with high stones
standing upright at the corners of the
walls, and with a hut enclosed in the
middle of the square. In the background
appears a mound enclosed by a
wall and surmounted by a hut. Thus
a hut figures as an essential part in each
type of tomb. However, Mariner
tells us that "they have several <i>fytocas</i>
which have no houses on them" (<i>Tonga
Islands</i>, i. 392 note *).</p></div>

was the Tooitonga's sister and ranked
above him. Her title means "the lady
Tooi-tonga." "Her dignity is very
great. She is treated as a kind of
divinity. Her rank is too high to
allow of her uniting herself in marriage
with any mortal: but it is not thought
wrong or degrading for her to have a
family, and in case of the birth of a
daughter the child becomes the <i>Tamaha</i>.
This lady rises higher than her mother
in rank, and is nearer the gods. Every
one approaches her with gifts and
homage. Her grandfather will bring
his offerings and sit down before her,
with all humility, like any of the
common people. Sick people come to
her for cure" (Miss Sarah S. Farmer,
<i>Tonga and the Friendly Islands</i>, p. 145,
apparently from the information of Mr.
John Thomas). Captain Cook learned
with surprise that Poulaho, the Tooitonga
of his time (whom Cook speaks
of as the king) acknowledged three
women as his superiors. "On our
inquiring, who these extraordinary
personages were, whom they distinguish
by the name and title of <i>Tammaha</i>, we
were told that the late king, Poulaho's
father, had a sister of equal rank, and
elder than himself; that she, by a man
who came from the island of Feejee,
had a son and two daughters; and that
these three persons, as well as their
mother, rank above Futtafaihe the
king. We endeavoured, in vain, to
trace the reason of this singular pre-eminence
of the <i>Tammahas</i>; for we
could learn nothing besides this account
of their pedigree. The mother and one
of the daughters called Tooeela-Kaipa,
live at Vavaoo. Latoolibooloo, the son,
and the other daughter, whose name is
Moungoula-Kaipa, reside at Tongataboo.
The latter is the woman who
is mentioned to have dined with me on
the 21st of June. This gave occasion
to our discovering her superiority over
the king, who would not eat in her
presence, though she made no scruple
to do so before him, and received from
him the customary obeisance, by touching
her foot." See Captain James
Cook, <i>Voyages</i>, v. 430 <i>sq.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_180_307" id="Footnote_180_307"></a><a href="#FNanchor_180_307"><span class="label">[180]</span></a> For the authorities, see the preceding
note. The measurements, to some
extent discrepant, are given by Dr.
Charles Forbes, Mr. Philip Hervey,
and the passengers of s.s. <i>Wairarapa</i>,
as reported by Sir Basil Thomson
<i>Journal of the Anthropological Institute</i>,
xxxii. 82 <i>sq.</i>), who had unfortunately
mislaid his own notes containing the
measurements. The statement that
the monument was surmounted by a
large bowl is made by Mr. Brenchley,
in whose sketch of the structure the
bowl figures. But Mr. Brenchley did
not himself see the monument, and
nobody else appears to have seen the
bowl. I suspect that the report of the
bowl may have originated in a hasty
reading of Mr. Hervey's statement that
"on the centre of it [the cross-stone]
a small cava bowl is scooped out,"
though in Mr. Brenchley's account the
bowl has seemingly increased in size.
Similarly in his report the height of
the uprights has grown to about thirty
feet, which appears to be just double
of their real size. Perhaps Mr.
Brenchley's erroneous allegation as to
the material of the monument similarly
originated in a misunderstanding of
Mr. Hervey's statement that "the
material is the coral rock, or coral rag
which are formed of stone brought
from Wallis's Island."</p></div>

"sun-worship, which people used to
go sniffing about to discover everywhere,
is found on the contrary only in
very exceptional regions or on lofty
table-lands of equatorial latitude." See
his book, <i>Die Voelker des Oestlichen
Asien</i>, iv. (Jena, 1868) p. 175. Nobody,
probably, has ever been better
qualified than Bastian to pronounce an
opinion on such a subject; for his
knowledge of the varieties of human
thought and religion, acquired both by
reading and travel, was immense. It
is only to be regretted that through
haste or negligence he too often gave
out the fruits of his learning in a form
which rendered it difficult to sift and
almost impossible to digest them.
Yet from his storehouse he brought
forth a treasure, of which we may
say what Macaulay said of the scholarship
of Parr, that it was "too often
buried in the earth, too often paraded
with injudicious and inelegant ostentation,
but still precious, massive, and
splendid."</p></div>

<h3>THE BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY AMONG THE SAMOANS</h3>


<h4>&sect; 1. <i>The Samoan Islands</i></h4>

<p>About three hundred and fifty or four hundred miles nearly
due north of Tonga lies Samoa, a group of islands situated
between 13&deg; 30' and 14&deg; 30' South latitude and between
168&deg; and 173&deg; West longitude. The native name of the
group is Samoa, which has this singularity, that it is
apparently the only name that designates a group of islands
in the Pacific; native names for all the other groups are
wanting, though each particular island has its own individual
name. Samoa is also known to Europeans as the
Navigators' Islands, a name bestowed on them by the
French explorer De Bougainville, who visited the group in
1768. The three most easterly islands were discovered in
1722 by Jacob Roggewein, a Dutch navigator, but he
appears not to have sighted the principal islands of the
group, which lie a good deal farther to the westward.
There is no record of any visit paid by a European vessel
to the islands in the interval between the visits of Roggewein
and De Bougainville. The whole archipelago was not
explored till 1787, when the French navigator La P&eacute;rouse
determined the position of all the islands.<a name="FNanchor_1_367" id="FNanchor_1_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_367" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The islands are disposed in a line running from west
to east. The most westerly, Savaii, is also the largest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
measuring about forty miles in length. Next follow two
small, but important islands, Apolima and Manona. Then
about three miles to the east of Manona comes Upolu, the
second of the islands in size, but the first in importance,
whether we regard population, harbours, or the extent of
soil available for cultivation. The channel which divides
Upolu from Savaii is from fifteen to twenty miles broad.
About forty miles to the east, or rather south-east, of
Upolu lies the island of Tutuila, with the fine and almost
landlocked harbour of Pangopango. It was in this island
that the French navigator La P&eacute;rouse lost his second in
command and twelve men in a fierce encounter with the
natives. The place where the fight took place is now
known as Massacre Cove.<a name="FNanchor_2_368" id="FNanchor_2_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_368" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Some fifty miles to the east
of Tutuila is situated a group of three small islands, Tau,
Ofu, and Olosenga, which are collectively known as Manua.</p>

<p>The islands are of volcanic formation and for the most
part surrounded by coral reefs, but the intervening seas
are quite free from danger, and the possession of good
harbours renders Samoa politically important. Viewed
from the sea the islands are mountainous and for the most
part wooded to the water's edge, except where a stretch
of fertile plain is interposed between the foot of the
mountains and the sea. The whole group presents to
the voyager a succession of enchanting views as he sails
along the coast. The eye is delighted by the prospect of
lofty and rugged mountains, their tops sometimes lost in
clouds, their slopes mantled in the verdure of evergreen
forests, varied here and there by rich valleys, by grey and
lofty cliffs, or by foaming waterfalls tumbling from heights
of hundreds of feet and showing like silvery threads
against the sombre green of the woods. Along the shore
rocks of black lava alternate with white sands dazzling in
the sunlight and fringed by groves of coco-nut palms, their
feathery tops waving and dancing in the breeze, while the
brilliant cobalt blue of the calm lagoon contrasts with the
olive-green of the deep sea, which breaks in a long line
of seething foam on the barrier reef. The scenery as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
whole combines romantic grandeur with wild and rank
luxuriance, thus winning for Samoa the reputation of being
among the loveliest of the islands which stud like gems the
bosom of the Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_3_369" id="FNanchor_3_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_369" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The island of Upolu in particular is wooded from its
summit to the water's edge, where in some places the roots
of the trees are washed by the surf, while in many places
clumps of mangrove trees spread out into the lagoon.
The forests are dense and more sombre even than those
of Brazil. The lofty trees shoot up to a great height
before sending out branches. At their feet grow ferns of
many sorts, while climbing vines and other creepers mantle
their trunks and sometimes even their tops. But the
gloom of the tropical forest is seldom or never relieved by
flowers of brilliant tints; the few flowers that bloom in
them are of a white or greyish hue, as if bleached for
want of the sunbeams, which are shut out by the thick
umbrageous foliage overhead.<a name="FNanchor_4_370" id="FNanchor_4_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_370" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Very different from the aspect presented by this luxuriant
vegetation is a great part of the interior of Savaii, the
largest island of the group. Here the desolate and forbidding
character of the landscape constantly reminds the
traveller of the dreadful forces which slumber beneath
his feet. Extinct volcanoes tower above him to heights of
four and five thousand feet, their steep and almost perpendicular
sides formed of volcanic ashes and denuded
of vegetation. For miles around these gloomy peaks the
ground presents nothing to the eye but black rocks, scoriae,
and ashes; the forlorn wayfarer seems to be traversing a
furnace barely extinguished, so visible are the traces of
fire on the sharp-pointed stones among which he picks
his painful way, and which in their twisted and tormented
forms seem still to preserve something of the movement of
the once boiling flood of molten lava. The whole country is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
a barren and waterless wilderness, a solitude destitute alike
of animal and of vegetable life, alternately parched by the
fierce rays of the tropical sun and deluged by hurricanes
of torrential rain. Even the natives cannot traverse these
dreary deserts; a European who strayed into them was
found, after five or six days, prostrate and almost dead on
the ground.<a name="FNanchor_5_371" id="FNanchor_5_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_371" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In Samoa, as in Tonga, volcanic activity has ominously
increased within less than a hundred years. Near the island
of Olosenga, in 1866 or 1867, a submarine volcano suddenly
burst out in eruption, vomiting forth rocks and mud to a
height, as it was estimated, of two thousand feet, killing the
fish and discolouring the sea for miles round.<a name="FNanchor_6_372" id="FNanchor_6_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_372" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Still later,
towards the end of 1905, another volcano broke out in the
bottom of a deep valley in the island of Savaii, and rose till
it attained a height of about four thousand feet. Down at
least to the year 1910 this immense volcano was still in full
action, and had covered many miles of country under a bed
of lava some ten or twelve feet thick, while with the same
river of molten matter it completely filled up the neighbouring
lagoon and replaced the level shore by an iron-bound coast
of volcanic cliffs.<a name="FNanchor_7_373" id="FNanchor_7_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_373" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A remarkable instance of these volcanic cliffs is furnished
by the little island of Apolima between Savaii and Upolu.
The islet, which is in fact the crater of an extinct volcano,
is only about a mile long by half to three-quarters of a mile
in width. On every side but one it presents to the sea a
precipitous wall of basaltic rock some thousand feet high,
while the interior is scooped out in the likeness of a great
cauldron. Only at one place is there a break in the cliffs
where a landing can be effected, and there the operation is
difficult and dangerous even in fine weather. In bad weather
the island is completely isolated. Thus it forms a strong
natural fortress, which under the conditions of native warfare
was almost impregnable.<a name="FNanchor_8_374" id="FNanchor_8_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_374" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>As might be expected from their volcanic formation, the
islands are subject to frequent and sometimes severe shocks
of earthquake. The veteran missionary, J. B. Stair, has
recorded that the shocks increased in number and violence
during the last years of his residence in Samoa. The last
of them was preceded by loud subterranean noises, which
lasted for hours, to the great alarm of the natives. At the
north-west of Upolu also, Mr. Stair used often to hear a
muffled sound, like the rumble of distant thunder, proceeding
apparently from the sea under the reef. This curious noise
always occurred on hot, sultry days, and seemed to strike a
note of warning, which filled natives and Europeans alike
with a sense of awe and insecurity.<a name="FNanchor_9_375" id="FNanchor_9_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_375" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Thus if, beheld from
some points of view, the Samoan islands appear an earthly
paradise, from others they present the aspect, and emit the
sounds, of an inferno.</p>

<p>And with all their natural beauty and charm the islands
cannot be said to enjoy a healthy climate. There is much
bad weather, particularly during the winter months, when
long and heavy rains, attended at times with high winds and
gales, are frequent. The air is more moist than in Tahiti,
and the vegetation in consequence is more rank and luxuriant.
Decaying rapidly under the ardent rays of a tropical sun, it
exhales a poisonous miasma. But the heat, oppressive and
exhausting at times, is nevertheless tempered by the sea and
land breezes, which blow daily, alternating with intervals of
calm between them. Besides these daily breezes the trade
wind blows regularly from the east during the fine season,
when the sky is constantly blue and cloudless. Yet with all
these alleviations the climate is enervating, and a long
residence in it is debilitating to the European frame.<a name="FNanchor_10_376" id="FNanchor_10_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_376" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Nor
are the natives exempt from the noxious effects of an atmosphere
saturated with moisture and impregnated with the
fumes of vegetable decay. The open nature of their dwellings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
which were without walls, exposed them to the heavy
night dews and rendered them susceptible to diseases of the
chest and lungs, from which they suffered greatly; consumption
in its many forms, coughs, colds, inflammation of the
chest and lungs, fevers, rheumatism, pleurisy, diarrh&#339;a, lumbago,
diseases of the spine, scrofula, and many other ailments
are enumerated among the disorders which afflicted them.
But the prevailing disease is elephantiasis, a dreadful malady
which attacks Europeans and natives alike. There are many
cases of epilepsy, and though idiots are rare, lunatics are less
infrequent. Hunchbacks are very common in both sexes,
and virulent ophthalmia is prevalent; many persons lose the
sight of one eye, and some are totally blinded; not less than
a fifth part of the population is estimated to suffer from this
malady.<a name="FNanchor_11_377" id="FNanchor_11_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_377" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Curiously enough, hunchbacks, who are said to
be very numerous on account of scrofula, used to be looked
on as special favourites of the spirits, and many of them,
on growing to manhood, were accordingly admitted to the
priesthood.<a name="FNanchor_12_378" id="FNanchor_12_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_378" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>During the stormy season, which lasts from December to
April, hurricanes sometimes occur, and are greatly dreaded
by the natives on account of the havoc which they spread
both among the crops and the houses. A steady rain, the
absence of the sun, a deathlike stillness of the birds and
domestic animals, and above all the dark and lowering
aspect of the sky, are the premonitory symptoms of the
coming calamity and inspire general consternation, while
the thunderous roar of the torrents and waterfalls in the
mountains strike on the ear with redoubled distinctness in
the prevailing silence which preludes the storm. Warned
by these ominous signs, the natives rush to secure their property
from being swept away by the fury of the blast. Some
hurry their canoes inland to places of comparative safety;
others pile trunks of banana-trees on the roofs of their houses
or fasten down the roofs by hanging heavy stones over them;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
while yet others bring rough poles, hastily cut in the forest,
and set them up inside the houses as props against the rafters,
to prevent the roof from falling in. Sometimes these efforts
are successful, sometimes futile, the hurricane sweeping everything
before it in its mad career, while the terrified natives
behold the fruits of months of toil, sometimes the growth of
years, laid waste in an hour. On such occasions the shores
have been seen flooded by the invading ocean, houses carried
clean away, and a forest turned suddenly into a bare and
treeless plain. Men have been forced to fling themselves
flat on the ground and to dig their hands into the earth to
save themselves from being whirled away and precipitated
into the sea or a torrent. In April 1850 the town of Apia,
the capital of the islands, was almost destroyed by one of
these cyclones. When the rage of the tornado is spent and
calm has returned, the shores of a harbour are apt to present
a melancholy scene of ruin and desolation, their shores
strewn with the wrecks of gallant ships which lately rode
there at anchor, their pennons streaming to the wind. So
it happened in the harbour of Apia on March 16th, 1889.
Before the tempest burst, there were many ships of various
nations anchored in the bay, among them five or six American
and German warships. When it was over, all were wrecked
and their shattered fragments littered the reefs. One vessel
alone, the British man-of-war, <i>Calliope</i>, was saved by the
courage and skill of the captain, who, seconded by the
splendid seamanship of the crew, forced his ship, in the very
teeth of the hurricane, out into the open sea, where he safely
weathered the storm.<a name="FNanchor_13_379" id="FNanchor_13_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_379" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>A special interest attaches to Samoa in so far as it is
now commonly believed to be the original seat of the
Polynesian race in the Pacific, from which their ancestors
gradually dispersed to the other islands of that vast ocean,
where their descendants are settled to this day. Polynesian
traditions point to such a dispersal from Samoa as a centre,
and they are confirmed by the name which the various
branches of the race give to their old ancestral home. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
original form of that name appears to have been Savaiki,
which through dialectical variations has been altered to
Hawaiki in New Zealand, to Hawaii in the Sandwich
Islands, to Havaii in Tahiti, to Havaiki in the Marquesas,
and to Avaiki in Rarotonga. In the Samoan dialect, which of
all the Polynesian dialects alone retains the letter S, the word
presumably appears as Savaii, the name of the largest island
of the group, which accordingly may be regarded, with some
probability, as the cradle-land of the Polynesians in the
Pacific; though native traditions indicate rather Upolu or
Manua as the place from which the canoes started on their
long and adventurous voyages. On the other hand in
favour of Savaii it has been pointed out that the island holds
a decided superiority over the other islands of the group in
respect of canoe-building; for it possesses extensive forests
of hard and durable timber, which is much sought after for
the keels and other parts of vessels; indeed, the large
sea-going canoes were generally, if not always, built on
Savaii, and maritime expeditions appear sometimes to have
started from its shores.<a name="FNanchor_14_380" id="FNanchor_14_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_380" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In proof that the Samoans have
long been settled in the islands which they now occupy, it
may be alleged that they appear to have no tradition of
any other home from which their ancestors migrated to their
present abode. With the single exception of a large village
called Matautu in Savaii, the inhabitants of which claim that
they came originally from Fiji, all the Samoans consider
themselves indigenous.<a name="FNanchor_15_381" id="FNanchor_15_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_381" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The Samoans and Tongans, says
Mr. S. Percy Smith, "formed part of the first migration into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the Pacific, and they have been there so long that they have
forgotten their early history. All the numerous legends as
to their origin seem to express their own belief in their
being autochthones, created in the Samoan Islands."<a name="FNanchor_16_382" id="FNanchor_16_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_382" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 2. <i>The Samoan Islanders, their character</i></h4>

<p>In spite of the many diseases prevalent among them,
the Samoans are commonly reckoned among the finest, as
well as the purest, specimens of the Polynesian race. Like
the Tongans, whom they closely resemble, they are generally
tall and shapely, with full rounded faces and limbs, but
without that grossness and laxity of fibre common in the
Tahitians. The average height of the men is said to be five
feet ten inches, but some of them are over six feet with the
thews and sinews of a Hercules. Their features, though
not always regular, are commonly pleasing; and in
particular the forehead is remarkable for its ample development,
which, with the breadth between the eyes, gives to the
countenance an expression of nobleness and dignity. Some
of the young men especially are models of manly beauty;
we read of one who, having decked his hair with the flowers
of the scarlet hibiscus, might have sat for an Antinous. The
women are comely enough, but strikingly inferior to the men
in point of personal beauty. The prevailing colour is a
light copper or olive brown, but the shade varies a good deal,
deepening somewhat in fishermen and others who are much
exposed to the sun; but it never approaches the dark
chocolate tint, or Vandyke brown, of the Melanesians. Their
hair is usually black and wavy, sometimes curly; but hardly
a vestige is to be seen among them of the crisped and
woolly hair and dusky complexion of the Melanesians, their
neighbours on the west.<a name="FNanchor_17_383" id="FNanchor_17_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_383" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The prepossessing appearance of the Samoans on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
whole does not belie their character. They are reputed to
be the most refined and civilised of all the native races of
the Pacific, and this superiority is said to manifest itself in
their social and domestic life.<a name="FNanchor_18_384" id="FNanchor_18_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_384" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The Samoans, we are told,
are a nation of gentlemen and contrast most favourably with
the generality of the Europeans who come among them.<a name="FNanchor_19_385" id="FNanchor_19_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_385" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
They are said to carry their habits of cleanliness and decency
to a higher point than the most fastidious of civilised
nations;<a name="FNanchor_20_386" id="FNanchor_20_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_386" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and the Samoan women appear to be honourably
distinguished by their modest behaviour and fidelity in
marriage, qualities which contrast with the profligacy of their
sex in other branches of the Polynesian race.<a name="FNanchor_21_387" id="FNanchor_21_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_387" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Equally
honourable to the men are the respect and kindness which,
according to the testimony of observers, they pay to their
women, whom they are said to regard as their equals.<a name="FNanchor_22_388" id="FNanchor_22_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_388" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The
aged were treated with respect and never abandoned; and
strangers were always received in the best house and
provided with food specially prepared for them.<a name="FNanchor_23_389" id="FNanchor_23_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_389" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Infanticide,
which was carried to an appalling and almost incredible
extent among some of the Polynesians,<a name="FNanchor_24_390" id="FNanchor_24_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_390" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> was unknown in
Samoa; abortion, indeed, was not uncommon, but once born
children were affectionately cared for and never killed or
exposed.<a name="FNanchor_25_391" id="FNanchor_25_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_391" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Wives and slaves were never put to death at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
chief's burial, that their souls might attend their dead lord to
the spirit land<a name="FNanchor_26_392" id="FNanchor_26_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_392" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, as was the practice in some of the other
islands, even in Tonga. Again, human sacrifices were not
offered by the Samoans to the gods within the time during
which the islands have been under the observation of Europeans;
but in some of the more remote traditions mention
is made of such sacrifices offered to the sun. Thus it is said
that in the mythical island of Papatea, somewhere away in
the east, the sun used to call for two victims every day, one
at his rising and another at his setting. This lasted for
eighty days. At such a rate of consumption the population
of the island was rapidly wasting away. To escape the
threatened doom, a brother and sister, named Luama and
Ui, fled from Papatea to Manua, the most easterly of the
Samoan islands, but they found to their consternation that
there too, the sun was demanding his daily victims. Every
house had to supply a victim in succession, and, when all
had yielded the tribute, it came to the first house in turn to
renew the sacrifice. The victim was laid out on a pandanus
tree, and there the sun devoured him or her. When the lot
fell on Luama, his heroic sister Ui insisted on taking his
place, and lying down, she cried, "O cruel sun! come and
eat your victim, we are all being devoured by you." But
the amorous sun fell in love with her and took her to wife,
at the same time putting an end to the human sacrifices.
Another story affirms that the heroine was a daughter of the
King of Manua, and that he yielded her up as an offering to
the sun in order to end the sacrifices by making her the
saviour of the people.<a name="FNanchor_27_393" id="FNanchor_27_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_393" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The Samoans, when they became known to Europe
in the nineteenth century, did not habitually indulge in
cannibalism; indeed, according to John Williams, one of
the earliest missionaries to the islands, they spoke of the
practice with great horror and detestation.<a name="FNanchor_28_394" id="FNanchor_28_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_394" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But we have
the testimony of other early missionaries that in their wars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
they occasionally resorted to it as a climax of hatred and
revenge, devouring some portion of an enemy who had
rendered himself peculiarly obnoxious by his cruelty or his
provocations. Traditions, too, are on record of chiefs who
habitually killed and devoured their fellow-creatures. A
form of submission which a conquered party used to adopt
towards their conquerors has also been interpreted as a relic
of an old custom of cannibalism. Representatives of the
vanquished party used to bow down before the victors, each
holding in his hands a piece of firewood and a bundle of
leaves, such as are used in dressing a pig for the oven.
This was as much as to say, "Kill us and cook us, if you
please." Criminals, too, were sometimes bound hand and
foot, slung on a pole, and laid down before the persons
they had injured, like pigs about to be killed and cooked.
Combining these and other indications we may surmise that
cannibalism was formerly not infrequent among the ancestors
of the Samoans, though among their descendants in the
nineteenth century the practice had almost wholly died out.<a name="FNanchor_29_395" id="FNanchor_29_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_395" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
It is further to the credit of the Samoans that their public
administration of justice was on the whole mild and humane.
Torture was never employed to wring the truth from
witnesses or the accused, and there seems to be only a
single case on record of capital punishment inflicted by
judicial sentence. At the same time private individuals
were free to avenge the adultery of a wife or the murder
of a kinsman by killing the culprit, and no blame attached
to them for so doing. The penalties imposed by the
sentence of a court or judicial assembly (<i>fono</i>) included
fines, banishment, and the destruction of houses, fruit-trees,
and domestic animals. But a criminal might also be condemned
by a court to suffer corporal punishment in one
form or another. He might, for example, be obliged to
wound himself by beating his head and chest with a stone
till the blood flowed freely; if he seemed to spare himself,
he would be ordered by the assembled chiefs to strike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
harder, and if he still faltered, the prompt and unsparing
application of a war club to his person effectually assisted
the execution of the sentence. Again, he might be condemned
to bite a certain acrid and poisonous root (called
in the native language <i>tevi</i>) which caused the mouth to
swell and the culprit to suffer intense agony for a considerable
time afterwards. Or he might have to throw up a
spiny and poisonous fish into the air and to catch it in his
naked hand as it fell; the sharp-pointed spines entered into
the flesh and inflicted acute pain and suffering. Or he
might be suspended by hands and feet from a pole and in
this attitude exposed to the broiling sun for many hours
together; or he might be hung by the feet, head downward,
from the top of a tall coco-nut tree and left there to expiate
his crime for a long time. For certain offences the culprit
was condemned to have his nose tattooed or his ears split. In
sentences of banishment the term of exile was never specified,
but when the sentence had been pronounced in full assembly,
and the offence was great, the culprit might live in exile for
years. When the punishment consisted in the destruction
of houses, plantations, and live stock, it was immediately
inflicted by the whole force of the district, under the direction
and superintendence of the leading men, who had taken part
in the assembly and passed the sentence. A whole family
might suffer in this way for the offence of one of its members,
and be driven into exile, after witnessing the burning of their
house, the killing of their pigs, and the barking of their breadfruit
trees.<a name="FNanchor_30_396" id="FNanchor_30_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_396" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> If such penalties seem to us in some cases
needlessly severe, they at least testify to a strong sense of
public justice developed among the Samoans, who had thus
advanced far enough to transfer, in some measure, the redress
of wrongs to judicial assemblies instead of leaving it to the
caprice of the injured individuals. Nevertheless the transference
was but imperfect: the administration of justice was
loose and irregular: for the most part every man was a law
to himself, and did what was right in his own eyes. An
aggrieved party would become his own judge, jury, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
executioner. The thirst for vengeance was slaked only by
the blood of a victim.<a name="FNanchor_31_397" id="FNanchor_31_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_397" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>It is another sign of the intellectual enlightenment of
the Samoans that they rose apparently superior to that
system of malignant magic, which kept their neighbours
the Melanesians in lifelong bondage. The experienced
missionary, Dr. George Brown, could not find in Samoa
any trace of the practice of that particular form of the black
art with which he was familiar in New Britain and other
Melanesian islands, the practice of procuring some object
which has belonged to an enemy or been touched by him,
and taking it to a sorcerer, that he may perform over it a
ceremony for the purpose of injuring the person from whom
the object has been obtained. The proceeding is one of the
commonest forms of sympathetic magic, but the Samoans
appear to have ignored or despised it.<a name="FNanchor_32_398" id="FNanchor_32_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_398" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Again, the silence
of our authorities on the subject of amulets and talismans
leaves us to infer that the Samoans were equally indifferent
to that branch of magic which seeks to ensure the safety
and prosperity of the individual by attaching a miscellaneous
collection of rubbish to his person, a system of ensurance
against evil and misfortune which has attained a prodigious
development among some savages, notably in Africa,<a name="FNanchor_33_399" id="FNanchor_33_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_399" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and
is very far from being unknown in Europe at the present
day. Again, unlike most savages, the Samoans were close
observers of the stars, not only reckoning the time of night
by the rising of particular stars, but steering by them when
they were out of sight of land.<a name="FNanchor_34_400" id="FNanchor_34_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_400" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Against these amiable and enlightened traits in the
Samoan character must be set their cruelty in war. If they
opened hostilities with a great deal of formal politeness,
they conducted them with great ferocity. No quarter was
given to men in battle, and captives were ruthlessly
slaughtered. Women were sometimes spared for the use
of their captors. Nor did death save the conquered from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the insults and outrages of the insolent victors. The slain
on the battlefield were treated with great indignity. Their
heads were cut off and carried in triumph to the village,
where they were piled up in a heap in the place of public
assembly, the head of the most important chief being given
the place of honour on the top of the pile. However, they
were not kept as trophies, but after remaining for some
hours exposed to public gaze were either claimed by the
relatives or buried on the spot. The headless trunks were
given to children to drag about the village and to spear,
stone, or mutilate at pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_35_401" id="FNanchor_35_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_401" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The first missionary to
Samoa was told in Manua that the victors used to scalp
their victims and present the scalps, with kava, either to the
king or to the relatives of the slain in battle, by whom
these gory trophies were highly prized. He mentions as an
example the case of a young woman, whose father had been
killed. A scalp of a foe having been brought to her, she
burnt it, strewed the ashes on the fire with which she cooked
her food, and then devoured the meat with savage satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_36_402" id="FNanchor_36_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_402" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
But the climax of cruelty and horror was reached
in a great war which the people of A&#8219;ana, in Upolu, waged
against a powerful combination of enemies. After a brave
resistance they were at last defeated, and the surviving warriors,
together with the aged and infirm, the women and children,
fled to the mountains, where they endeavoured to hide
themselves from their pursuers in the caves and the depths
of the forest. But they were hunted out and brought down
to the seashore; and an immense pit having been dug and
filled with firewood, they were all, men, women, and children,
thrown into it and burnt alive. The dreadful butchery went
on for days. Four hundred victims are said to have perished.
The massacre was perpetrated at the moment when the first
missionaries were landing in Samoa. From the opposite
shore they beheld the mountains enveloped in the flames
and smoke of the funeral pile. The decisive battle had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
been fought that very morning. For many years a great
black circle of charcoal marked the scene and preserved the
memory of the fatal transaction.<a name="FNanchor_37_403" id="FNanchor_37_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_403" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 3. <i>Houses, Agriculture, and Industries</i></h4>

<p>Like all the Polynesians, the Samoans are not nomadic,
but live in settled villages. The typical Samoan house is
commonly described as oval or elliptical, though in fact it
would seem to be of oblong shape with semicircular ends.
But many houses were circular in shape, and with their
conical thatched roofs resembled gigantic beehives. From
the Tongans the Samoans also borrowed the custom of
building oblong quadrangular houses, which were called
<i>afolau</i>. The best houses, in particular those of important
chiefs, were built on raised platforms of stones about three
feet high. One of the circular houses would measure about
thirty-five feet in diameter by a hundred in circumference.
Two or three posts in the centre of the house, some twenty
feet high, supported the roof, the lower end of which rested
on a series of short posts, four or five feet high, placed at
intervals of about four feet all round the house. The
intervals between these posts were sometimes closed by
thatch neatly tied to sticks, which were planted upright in
the ground and fastened to the eaves; but more commonly,
it would seem, the intervals between the posts were left
open and only closed at night by blinds made of coco-nut
leaves, which could be let down or pulled up like Venetian
blinds. During the day these blinds were drawn up, so
that there was a free current of air all through the house.
The roofs of the best houses were made of bread-fruit wood
carefully thatched with leaves of the wild sugar-cane; when
well made, the thatch might last seven years. The circular
roofs were so constructed that they could be lifted clean off
the posts and removed anywhere, either by land or on a
raft of canoes. The whole house could also be transported;
and as Samoan houses were often bartered, or given as
presents, or paid as fines, it frequently happened that they
were removed from place to place. In the whole house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
there was not a single nail or spike: all joints were made
by exactly corresponding notches and secured by cinnet, that
is cordage made from the dried fibre of the coco-nut husk.
The timber of the best houses was the wood of the bread-fruit
tree; and, if protected against damp, it would last fifty
years. The floor of the house was composed of stones,
overlaid with fine gravel and sand. In the centre of the
floor was the fire-place, a circular hollow two or three feet
in diameter and a few inches deep, lined with hardened
clay. It was not used for cooking, but for the purpose of
lighting up the house by night. The cooking was never
done in the house, but always in the open air outside on an
oven of hot stones. An ordinary Samoan house consisted
of a single apartment, which served as the common parlour,
dining-room, and bedroom of the family. But at night
small tents made of bark-cloth were hung from the ridge-pole,
and under them the various members of the family
slept separately, the tents serving them at the same time as
curtains to protect them against the mosquitoes. Formerly,
the houses of the principal chiefs were surrounded with two
fences; the outer of the two was formed of strong posts
and had a narrow zigzag entrance, several yards long,
leading to an opening in the inner fence, which was made
of reeds. But with the advent of a more peaceful epoch
these fortified enclosures for the most part disappeared.
Houses constructed on the Tongan model were often very
substantially built: a double row of posts and cross-beams
supported the roof. These houses were found better able
to resist the high winds which prevail at one season of the
year.<a name="FNanchor_38_404" id="FNanchor_38_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_404" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Like the rest of the Polynesians, the Samoans are an
agricultural people, and subsist mainly by the fruits of the
earth, though the lagoons and reefs furnish them with a
large supply of fish and shell-fish, of which they are very
fond. They all, but especially persons of rank, occasionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
regaled themselves on pigs, fowls, and turtle. But bread-fruit,
taro, yams, bananas, and coco-nuts formed the staff of
life in Samoa. As the soil is very rich and the hot, damp
climate is eminently favourable to the growth of vegetation,
food was always abundant, and the natives could procure
the necessaries and even the luxuries of life at the cost of
very little labour; if they tilled the soil, it was rather to
vary their diet than to wring a scanty subsistence from a
niggardly nature. Coco-nut palms, bread-fruit and chestnut
trees, and wild yams, bananas, and plantains abound throughout
the islands, and require little attention to make them
yield an ample crop. For about half the year the Samoans
have a plentiful supply of food from the bread-fruit trees:
during the other half they depend principally upon their
taro plantations. While the bread-fruit is in season, every
family lays up a quantity of the ripe fruit in a pit lined
with leaves and covered with stones. The fruit soon
ferments and forms a soft mass, which emits a very vile
smell every time the pit is opened. In this state it may be
kept for years, for the older and more rotten the fruit is, the
better the natives like it. They bake it, with the juice of
the coco-nut, into flat cakes, which are eaten when the ripe
fruit is out of season or when taro is scarce. For taro is on
the whole the staple food of the Samoans; it grows all the
year round. The water of the coco-nut furnishes a cool,
delicious, slightly effervescing beverage, which is peculiarly
welcome to the hot and weary wayfarer far from any spring
or rivulet.<a name="FNanchor_39_405" id="FNanchor_39_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_405" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>To obtain land for cultivation the Samoans went into
the forest and cut down the brushwood and creeping vines
with small hatchets or large knives. The large forest-trees
they destroyed by chopping away the bark in a circle round
the trunk and then kindling a fire of brushwood at the foot
of the tree. Thus in the course of a few days a fair-sized
piece of ground would be cleared, nothing of the forest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
remaining but charred trunks and leafless branches. Then
followed the planting. The agricultural instruments employed
were of the simplest pattern. A dibble, or pointed
stick of hard wood, was used to make the hole in which the
plant was deposited. This took the place of a plough, and
a branch served the purpose of a harrow. Sometimes the
earth was dug and smoothed with the blade of a canoe
paddle. The labour of clearing and planting the ground
was done by the men, but the task of weeding it generally
devolved on the women. The first crop taken from a piece
of land newly cleared in the forest was yams, which require
a peculiar culture and frequent change of site, two successive
crops being seldom obtained from the same land. After
the first crop of yams had been cleared off, taro was planted
several times in succession; for this root does not, like
yams, require a change of site. However, we are told that
a second crop of taro grown on the same land was very
inferior to the first, and that as a rule the land was allowed
to remain fallow until the trees growing on it were as thick
as a man's arm, when it was again cleared for cultivation.
In the wet season taro was planted on the high land from
one to four miles inland from the village; other kinds of
taro were planted in the swamps, and these were considered
more succulent than the taro grown on the uplands. The
growing crops of taro were weeded at least twice a year.
The natives resorted to irrigation, when they had the
means; and they often dug trenches to drain away the
water from swampy ground. Yams also required attention;
for sticks had to be provided on which the plants could run.
The fruit ripens only once a year, but it was stored up, and
with care would keep till the next season. The natives
found neither yams nor bread-fruit so nourishing as taro.<a name="FNanchor_40_406" id="FNanchor_40_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_406" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The degree of progress which any particular community
has made in civilisation may be fairly gauged by the degree
of subdivision of labour among its members; for it is only
by restricting his energies to a particular craft that a man
can attain to any perfection in it. Judged by this standard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the Samoans had advanced some way on the road to
civilisation, since among them the division of labour was
carried out to a considerable extent: in their native state
they had not a few separate trades or professions, some of
which may even be said to have developed the stability and
organisation of trade guilds. Among them, for example,
house-building, canoe-building, tattooing, and the making
of nets and fish-hooks were distinct crafts, which, though
not strictly hereditary, were usually confined to particular
families. Thus by long practice and experience handed
down from generation to generation a considerable degree
of skill was acquired, and a considerable degree of reputation
accrued to the family. Every trade had its particular
patron god and was governed by certain well-known rules.
The members formed, indeed, we are told, a trade union
which was remarkably effective. Thus they had rules
which prescribed the time and proportions of payment to be
made at different stages of the work, and these rules were
strictly observed and enforced by the workmen. For
example, in the house-building trade, it was a standing
custom that after the sides and one end of a house were
finished, the principal part of the payment should be made.
If the carpenters were dissatisfied with the amount of payment,
they simply left off work and walked away, leaving
the house unfinished, and no carpenter in the whole length
and breadth of Samoa would dare to finish it, for it would
have been as much as his business or even his life was
worth to undertake the job. Anyone so foolhardy as thus
to set the rules of the trade at defiance would have been
attacked by the other workmen and robbed of his tools; at
the best he would receive a severe thrashing, at the worst he
might be killed. A house might thus stand unfinished for
months or even years. Sooner or later, if he was to have a
roof over his head, the unfortunate owner had to yield to
the trade union and agree to such terms as they might
dictate. If it happened that the house was almost finished
before the fourth and final payment was made, and the
builder at that stage of the proceedings took offence, he
would remove a beam from the roof before retiring in
dudgeon, and no workman would dare to replace it. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
rules in the other trades, such as canoe-building and tattooing,
were practically the same. In canoe-building, for
example, five separate payments were made to the builders
at five stages of the work; and if at any stage the workmen
were dissatisfied with the pay, they very unceremoniously
abandoned the work until the employer apologised or came
to terms. No other party of workmen would have the
temerity to finish the abandoned canoe upon pain of bringing
down on their heads the wrath of the whole fraternity
of canoe-builders; any such rash offenders against the rules
of the guild would be robbed of their tools, expelled from
their clan, and prohibited from exercising their calling
during the pleasure of the guild. Such strides had the
Samoans made in the direction of trade unionism.<a name="FNanchor_41_407" id="FNanchor_41_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_407" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>In addition to their household duties women engaged
in special work of their own, particularly in the manufacture
of bark-cloths and of fine mats; but among them there
seems to have been no subdivision of labour and consequently
no professional guilds. In all families the making
of bark-cloth and mats was carried on by the women
indifferently, though some no doubt excelled others in the
skill of their handiwork. The cloth was made from the
bark of the paper-mulberry (<i>Morus papyrifera</i>), which was
beaten out on boards with a grooved beetle. The sound
of these beetles ringing on the boards, though not very
musical, was a familiar sound in a Samoan village. The
fine mats, on the manufacture of which the Samoans
particularly prided themselves, were worn as dresses on
ceremonial occasions. They were made from the leaves
of a large plant which the natives call <i>lau ie</i>; the leaves
closely resemble those of the pandanus, but are larger.
These mats were of a straw or cream colour, and were
sometimes fringed with tufts of scarlet feathers of the
paroquet. They were thin and almost as flexible as calico.
Many months, sometimes even years, were spent over the
making of a single mat. Another kind of fine mat was
made from the bark of a plant of the nettle tribe (<i>Hibiscus</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
<i>tiliaceus</i>), which grows wild over the islands. Mats of the
latter sort were shaggy on one side, and, being bleached
white, resembled fleecy sheep-skins. These fine mats,
especially those made from the leaves of the pandanus-like
plant, were considered by the Samoans to be their
most valuable property; they were handed down as heirlooms
from father to son, and were so much coveted that
wars were sometimes waged to obtain possession of them.
The pedigrees of the more famous mats, particularly those
fringed with red feathers, were carefully kept, and when
they changed hands, their history was related with solemn
precision. Age enhanced their value; and their tattered
condition, deemed a proof of antiquity, rather added to than
detracted from the estimation in which they were held.
The wealth of a family consisted of its mats; with them
it remunerated the services of carpenters, boat-builders,
and tattooers. The mats formed, indeed, a sort of currency
or medium of exchange; for while the Samoans were not
in general a trading people, and there was little or no
actual buying and selling among them, there was nevertheless
a considerable exchange of property on many occasions;
at marriage, for example, it was customary for the bride's
family to give mats and bark-cloth as her dowry, while
the bridegroom's family provided a house, canoes, and other
articles. But though the fine mats were thus paid away
or given in exchange, they had no fixed negotiable value,
and thus did not serve the purpose of money.<a name="FNanchor_42_408" id="FNanchor_42_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_408" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 4. <i>Rights of Property</i></h4>

<p>In Samoa the rights of private property, both personal
and landed, were fully recognised, but with certain limitations.
The lands were owned alike by chiefs and by heads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of families; the laws regulating their possession were very
definite. In no case did the whole of the land belong to
the chiefs. Every family owned portions of land not only
in the village and adjoining gardens, but far away in the
unreclaimed forests of the interior. The title, which passed
by inheritance, generally vested in the family; but the
family was represented by the head, who often claimed
the right to dispose of it by sale or otherwise. Yet he
dared not do anything without consulting all concerned;
were he to persist in thwarting the wishes of the rest, they
would take his title from him and give it to another.
Sometimes, however, the title to landed property vested
in individual owners. The legitimate heir was the oldest
surviving brother, but occasionally he waived his right
in favour of one of the sons. Women might hold land
when the male side of a family was extinct. The boundaries
of land were well defined, being marked by pathways,
natural limits, such as a river, or by trenches and stones
half buried in the ground. Every inch of ground had its
owner, even to the tops of the mountains. Trespass by
a neighbouring village would be resisted, if necessary, by
force of arms.<a name="FNanchor_43_409" id="FNanchor_43_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_409" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In regard to personal property it may be said that, like
landed property, it belonged rather to the family than to
the individual; for no Samoan could refuse to give, without
an equivalent, anything which any member of his family
asked for. In this way boats, tools, garments, and so forth
passed freely from hand to hand. Nay, a man could enter
the plantation of a relative and help himself to the fruit
without asking the owner's leave; such an appropriation
was not considered to be stealing. Under this communistic
system, as it has been called, accumulation of property
was scarcely possible, and industry was discouraged. Why
should a diligent man toil when he knew that the fruit of
his labour might all be consumed by lazy kinsfolk? He
might lay out a plantation of bananas, and when they
were full-grown, bunch after bunch might be plucked and
eaten by his less industrious relations, until, exasperated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
beyond endurance, the unfortunate owner would cut down
all the remaining trees. No matter how hard a man
worked, he could not keep his earnings; they all soon
passed out of his hands into the common stock of the
clan. The system, we are told, ate like a canker-worm at
the roots of individual and national progress.<a name="FNanchor_44_410" id="FNanchor_44_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_410" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 5. <i>Government, Social Ranks, Respect for Chiefs</i></h4>

<p>The native government of Samoa was not, like that
of Tonga, a centralised despotism. Under the form of a
monarchy and aristocracy the political constitution was
fundamentally republican and indeed democratic. The
authority of the king and chiefs was limited and more
or less nominal; practically Samoa consisted of a large
number of petty independent and self-governing communities,
which sometimes combined for defence or common action
in a sort of loose federation.<a name="FNanchor_45_411" id="FNanchor_45_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_411" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>To a superficial observer the aristocratic cast of Samoan
society might at first sight seem very marked. The social
ranks were sharply divided from each other, and the inferior
orders paid great formal deference to their superiors. At
the head of all ranked the chiefs (<i>alii</i>); but even among
them the ordinary chiefs were distinct from the sacred
chiefs (<i>alii paia</i>), who enjoyed the highest honours. These
sacred chiefs preserved their pedigrees for twenty or more
generations with as great care as the oldest and proudest
families in Europe, and they possessed many feudal rights
and privileges which were as well known and as fully
acknowledged as are, or were, those of any lord of a manor
in England. The task of preserving a record of a chief's
pedigrees was entrusted to his orator or spokesman, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
belonged to a lower social rank (that of the <i>tulafales</i>).<a name="FNanchor_46_412" id="FNanchor_46_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_412" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
The influence of chiefs was supported by the belief that
they possessed some magical or supernatural power, by
which they could enforce their decisions.<a name="FNanchor_47_413" id="FNanchor_47_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_413" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Their persons
were sacred or taboo. They might not be touched by
any one. No one might sit beside them. In the public
assemblies a vacant place was left on each side of the seat
of honour which they occupied. Some chiefs were so holy
that they might not even be looked at by day. Their food
might not be handed to them, but was thrown to them,
and it was so sacred that no one might eat any of it which
they had left over.<a name="FNanchor_48_414" id="FNanchor_48_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_414" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>"The sacredness attributed to many chiefs of high
rank gave rise to observances which were irksome to their
families and dependents, since whatever they came in
contact with required to undergo the ceremony of <i>lulu&#8219;u</i>,
or sprinkling with a particular kind of cocoanut-water
(<i>niu-ui</i>); both to remove the sanctity supposed to be
communicated to the article or place that had touched the
chief, and also to counteract the danger of speedy death,
which was believed to be imminent to any person who
might touch the sacred chief, or anything that he had
touched; so great was the mantle of sanctity thrown
around these chiefs, although unconnected with the priesthood.
Thus the spot where such a chief had sat or slept
was sprinkled with water immediately he had left it, as
were also the persons who had sat on either side of him
when he received company, as well as all the attendants
who had waited upon him.</p>

<p>"This remarkable custom was also observed on other
occasions. It was always used on the occasion of deposing
a chief, and depriving him of his <i>Ao</i>, or titles, in which
case the ceremony was performed by some of those who
had either conferred the titles or had the power to do so.
In the case of O le Tamafainga, the usurper who was killed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
in A&#8219;ana in 1829, his body was first sprinkled with
cocoanut-water, and his title of <i>O le Tuia&#8219;ana</i> recalled from
him, before he was hewn in pieces. The ceremony consisted
of sprinkling the body with cocoanut-water, and the
officiating chief or <i>Tulafale</i> saying, 'Give us back our <i>Ao</i>,'
by which means the title was recalled, and the sacredness
attaching to it was dispelled. It was also used over persons
newly tattooed, and upon those who contaminated themselves
by contact with a dead body. In each of these cases the
ceremony was carefully observed, and reverently attended
to, as very dire consequences were considered certain to
follow its omission."<a name="FNanchor_49_415" id="FNanchor_49_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_415" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Thus the sacredness of a chief was
deemed dangerous to all persons with whom he might
come, whether directly or indirectly, into contact; it was
apparently conceived as a sort of electric fluid which discharged
itself, it might be with fatal effect, on whatever it
touched. And the sacredness of a chief was clearly classed
with the uncleanness of a dead body, since contact with
a dead body involved the same dangerous consequences as
contact with the sacred person of a chief and had to be
remedied in precisely the same manner. The two conceptions
of holiness and uncleanness, which to us seem
opposite and even contradictory, blend in the idea of taboo,
in which both are implicitly held as it were in solution. It
requires the analytic tendency of more advanced thought to
distinguish the two conceptions, to precipitate, as it were, the
components of the solution in the testing-tube of the mind.</p>

<p>The profound respect which the Samoans entertained
for their chiefs manifested itself in yet another fashion. A
special form of speech was adopted in addressing a chief, in
conversing in his presence, or even in alluding to him in his
absence. Thus there arose what is called a chiefs' language,
or polite diction, which was used exclusively in speaking to
or of a chief, whether the speaker was a common man or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
chief of lower rank. But it was never used by a chief when
he was speaking of himself. Persons of high rank, in
addressing others and alluding to themselves, always employed
ordinary language and sometimes the very lowest
terms; so that it was often amusing to listen to expressions
of feigned humility uttered by a proud man, who would
have been indignant indeed if the same terms which he
applied to himself had been applied to him by others.
Thus, for example, the actions of sitting, talking, eating,
sleeping, and dying were expressed by different terms according
as the agent was a chief or a common man. The
ordinary word for a house was <i>fale</i>; but a chief's house was
called <i>maota</i>. The common word for anger was <i>ita</i>; the
polite term was <i>toasa</i>. To sleep in ordinary language was
<i>moe</i>, but in polite language it was <i>tof&#257;</i> or <i>to&aacute;</i>. To be sick
in common speech was <i>mai</i>, but in polite language it was
<i>ngasengase, faatafa, pulu pulusi</i>. To die was <i>mate</i> or <i>pe</i>
(said of animals), or <i>oti</i> (said of men); but the courtly expressions
for death were <i>maliu</i> ("gone"), <i>folau</i> ("gone on a
voyage"), <i>fale-lauasi, ngasololo ao</i>, and a number of others.
The terms substituted in the court language sometimes
had a meaning the very opposite of that borne by the
corresponding terms in the ordinary language. For example,
in the court language firewood was called <i>polata</i>,
which properly means the stem of the banana plant, a wood
that is incombustible. If the use of an ordinary word in
the presence of a chief were unavoidable, it had to be
prefaced by the apologetic phrase <i>veaeane</i>, literally "saving
your presence," every time the word was spoken. Nay, the
courtly language itself varied with the rank of the chief
addressed or alluded to. For example, if you wished to
say that a person had come, you would say <i>alu</i> of a common
man; <i>alala</i> of a head of a household or landowner (<i>tulafale</i>);
<i>maliu</i> of a petty chief; <i>susu</i> of a chief of the second class;
and <i>afiu</i> of a chief of the highest rank.<a name="FNanchor_50_416" id="FNanchor_50_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_416" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The same respect
which was shown in the use of words descriptive of a chief's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
actions or possessions was naturally extended to his own
name, when he belonged to the class of sacred chiefs. If
his name happened to be also the name of a common
object, it ceased to be used to designate the thing in
question, and a new word or phrase was substituted for it.
Henceforth the old name of the object was dropped and
might never again be pronounced in the chief's district nor
indeed anywhere in his presence. In one district, for
example, the chief's name was Flying-fox; hence the
ordinary word for flying-fox (<i>re'a</i>) was dropped, and that
species of bat was known as "bird of heaven" (<i>manu langi</i>).<a name="FNanchor_51_417" id="FNanchor_51_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_417" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Again, when the chief of Pango-pango, in the island of
Tutuila, was called Maunga, which means "mountain," that
word might never be used in his presence, and a courtly
term was substituted for it.<a name="FNanchor_52_418" id="FNanchor_52_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_418" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This is only one instance of
the ways in which the dialects of savages tend to vary from
each other under the influence of superstition.</p>

<p>Yet despite the extraordinary deference thus paid to
chiefs in outward show, the authority which they possessed
was for the most part very limited; indeed in the ordinary
affairs of life the powers and privileges of a chief were little
more than nominal, and he moved about among the people
and shared their everyday employments just like a common
man. Thus, for example, he would go out with a fishing
party, work in his plantation, help at building a house or a
canoe, and even lend a hand in cooking at a native oven.
So strong was the democratic spirit among the Samoans.
The ordinary duties of a chief consisted in administering
the law, settling disputes, punishing transgressors, appointing
feasts, imposing taboos, and leading his people in war. It
was in time of war that a chief's dignity and authority were
at their highest, but even then he could hardly maintain
strict discipline.<a name="FNanchor_53_419" id="FNanchor_53_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_419" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> However, the influence of chiefs varied a
good deal and depended in great measure on their personal
character. If besides his hereditary rank a chief was a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of energy and ability, he might become practically supreme
in his village or district. Some chiefs even used their power
in a very tyrannical manner.<a name="FNanchor_54_420" id="FNanchor_54_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_420" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>But for the abuse of power by their nominal rulers the
Samoans had a remedy at hand. When a chief rendered
himself odious to his people by tyranny and oppression, the
householders or gentry (<i>tulafales</i>) and neighbouring chiefs
would not uncommonly depose him and transfer his office
to another; in extreme cases they might banish him or
even put him to death. The place of banishment for exiled
chiefs was the island of Tutuila. Thither the fallen potentate
was conveyed under custody in a canoe, and on landing he
was made to run the gauntlet between two rows of the
inhabitants, who belaboured him with sticks, pelted him
with stones, or subjected him to other indignities. He was
lucky if he escaped with nothing worse than bruises, for
sometimes the injuries inflicted were severe or actually
fatal.<a name="FNanchor_55_421" id="FNanchor_55_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_421" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Chieftainship was hereditary in the male line, but
did not necessarily pass from father to son; the usual heir
would seem to have been the eldest surviving brother, and
next to him one of the sons. But a dying chief might
nominate his successor, though the final decision rested with
the heads of families. Failing a male heir, a daughter
might be appointed to, or might assume, the prerogative of
chieftainship.<a name="FNanchor_56_422" id="FNanchor_56_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_422" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>In addition to their hereditary nobility chiefs might be
raised to higher rank by the possession of titles (<i>ao</i>), which
were in the gift of certain ruling towns or villages. When
four or, according to another account, five of these titles
were conferred upon a single chief, he was called <i>o le tupu</i>,
or King of Samoa. But if the constituencies were not
unanimous in their choice of a candidate, the throne might
remain vacant for long periods. Thus the monarchy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Samoa was elective; the king was chosen by a hereditary
aristocracy, and his powers were tempered by the rights and
privileges of the nobility. Yet under the show of a limited
monarchy the constitution was essentially a federal republic.<a name="FNanchor_57_423" id="FNanchor_57_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_423" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
The ceremony of anointing a King of Samoa in ancient
times appears to have curiously resembled a similar solemnity
in monarchical Europe. It took place in presence of a
large assembly of chiefs and people. A sacred stone was
consecrated as a throne, or rather stool, on which the king
stood, while a priest, who must also be a chief, called upon
the gods to behold and bless the king, and pronounced
denunciations against such as should fail to obey him. He
then poured scented oil from a native bottle over the head,
shoulders, and body of the king, and proclaimed his several
titles and honours.<a name="FNanchor_58_424" id="FNanchor_58_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_424" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Next below the chiefs ranked an inferior order of nobility
called <i>tulafales</i> or <i>faipules</i>, who are variously described
as householders, councillors, and secondary chiefs. They
formed a very powerful and influential class; indeed we are
told that they generally exercised greater authority than the
chiefs, and that the real control of districts often centred in
their hands. They usually owned large lands: they were
the principal advisers of the chiefs: the orators were usually
selected from their number: the <i>ao</i> or titles of districts were
always in their gift; and they had the power, which they
did not scruple to use, of deposing and banishing an unpopular
chief. Sometimes a chief contrived to bring them
into subjection to himself; but as a rule they were a sturdy
class, who did not shrink from speaking out their minds to
their social superiors, often uttering very unpalatable truths
and acting with great determination when the conduct of a
chief incurred their displeasure. In short, they made laws,
levied fines, and generally ruled the village.<a name="FNanchor_59_425" id="FNanchor_59_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_425" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Below the <i>tulafales</i> ranked the <i>faleupolu</i> or House of
Upolu, and the <i>tangata nuu</i> or Men of the Land. The
former were considerable landowners and possessed much
influence; the latter were the humblest class, bearing arms
in time of war, and cultivating the soil, fishing, and cooking
in time of peace. But they were far from being serfs;
most of them were eligible for the position of head of a
family, if, when a vacancy occurred, the choice of the family
fell upon them.<a name="FNanchor_60_426" id="FNanchor_60_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_426" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> For the title of head of a family was not
hereditary. A son might succeed his father in the dignity;
but the members of the family would sometimes pass over
the son and confer the title on an uncle, a cousin, or even a
perfect stranger, if they desired to increase the numerical
strength of the family.<a name="FNanchor_61_427" id="FNanchor_61_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_427" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The villages of the Samoans were practically self-governing
and independent communities, though every
village was more or less loosely federated with the other
villages of its district. Each district or confederation of
villages had its capital (<i>laumua</i>) or ruling town. These
federal capitals, however, possessed no absolute authority
over the other villages of the district; and though great
respect was always shown to them, the people of the
district, or even of a particular village, would often dissent
from the decisions of the capital and assert their independence
of action.<a name="FNanchor_62_428" id="FNanchor_62_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_428" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Of this independence a notable instance
occurred when the Catholic missionaries first settled in
Samoa. Under the influence of the Protestant missionaries
a federal assembly had passed a decree strictly forbidding
the admission of Roman Catholics to the islands, and threatening
with war any community that should dare to harbour
the obnoxious sect. The better to enforce the decree,
prayers were publicly offered up in the chapels that God
would be pleased to keep all Papists out of Samoa. To
these charitable petitions the deity seems to have turned a
deaf ear; for, in spite of prayers and prohibitions, two
Catholic priests and a lay brother landed and were hospitably
received and effectually protected by the people of a village,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
who paid no heed either to the remonstrances of the chiefs
or to the thunders of the federal assembly.<a name="FNanchor_63_429" id="FNanchor_63_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_429" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The population of a village might be from two to five
hundred persons, and there might be eight or ten villages in
a district. Throughout the Samoan islands there were in
all eight of these separate districts. The union of the villages
in a district was voluntary; they formed by common consent
a petty state for their mutual protection. When war was
threatened by another district, no single village acted alone;
the whole district, or state, assembled at their capital and
held a special parliament to concert the measures to be
taken.<a name="FNanchor_64_430" id="FNanchor_64_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_430" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The boundaries of the districts were well known
and zealously guarded, if necessary, by force of arms against
the aggression of a neighbouring state. The wardenship of
the marches was committed to the two nearest villages on
either side, the inhabitants of which were called Boundary-Keepers.
Between two such villages in former days mutual
ill-feeling constantly existed and border feuds were frequent.<a name="FNanchor_65_431" id="FNanchor_65_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_431" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The form of government both of the village and of the
district was parliamentary. Affairs were discussed and
settled in a representative assembly (<i>fono</i>), composed of the
leading men of each village or district. These representatives
included the chiefs, together with the householders or
landowners (<i>tulafales</i>) and the inferior gentry (the <i>faleupolu</i>).
The more weighty affairs, such as declaring war or making
peace, or any matters of importance which concerned the
whole district, were debated in the general parliament of the
district, while business of purely local interest was transacted
in the parliament of the village. It was the privilege of the
capital to convene the district parliament, to preside over its
deliberations, to settle disputed points, to sum up the proceedings,
and to dismiss the assembly. These meetings
were usually conducted with much formality and decorum.
They were always held in the large public place (<i>malae</i> or
<i>marae</i>) of the village or town. It was an open green spot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
surrounded by a circle of trees and houses. The centre was
occupied by a large house which belonged to the chief and
was set apart as a caravansary for the entertainment of
strangers and visitors. Members of all the three orders
which composed the parliament had the right to address it;
but the speaking was usually left to the householders or
landowners (<i>tulafales</i>). Each chief had generally attached
to him one of that order who acted as his mouthpiece;
and in like manner each settlement retained the services of
a member of the order, who was the leading orator of the
district. Decisions were reached not by voting but by
general consent, the discussion being prolonged until some
conclusion, satisfactory to the greater part of the members,
and particularly to the most influential, was arrived at. One
of the principal prerogatives of the king seems to have been
that of convoking a parliament; though, if he refused to do
so, when circumstances seemed to require it, the assembly
would undoubtedly have met without him. The functions
of these assemblies were judicial as well as legislative and
deliberative. Offenders were arraigned before them and, if
found guilty, were condemned and punished.<a name="FNanchor_66_432" id="FNanchor_66_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_432" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>It says much for the natural ability of the Samoans
that they should have attained to a level of culture so
comparatively high with material resources so scanty and
defective. Nature, indeed, supplied them with abundance of
food and timber, but she denied them the metals, which were
unknown in the islands until they were introduced from
Europe. In their native state, accordingly, the Samoans
were still in the Stone Age, their principal tools being stone
axes and adzes, made mainly from a close-grained basalt
which is found in the island of Tutuila. Of these axes the
rougher were chipped, but the finer were ground. Shells
were used as cutting instruments and as punches to bore
holes in planks; and combs, neatly carved out of bone,
were employed as instruments in tattooing. A wooden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
dibble served them instead of a plough to turn up the earth.
The only skins they prepared were those of sharks and some
other fish, which they used as rasps for smoothing woodwork.
The art of pottery was unknown.<a name="FNanchor_67_433" id="FNanchor_67_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_433" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Food was cooked
in ovens of hot stones;<a name="FNanchor_68_434" id="FNanchor_68_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_434" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> fire was kindled by the friction of
wood, the method adopted being what is called the stick-and-groove
process.<a name="FNanchor_69_435" id="FNanchor_69_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_435" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>We now pass to a consideration of the religion of these
interesting people, especially in regard to the human soul
and its destiny after death.</p>


<h4>&sect; 6. <i>Religion: Gods of Families, Villages, and Districts</i></h4>

<p>The first missionary to Samoa, John Williams, was
struck by the contrast between the religion of the Samoans
and the religion of the other Polynesian peoples whom he
had studied. "The religious system of the Samoans," he
says, "differs essentially from that which obtained at the
Tahitian, Society, and other islands with which we are
acquainted. They have neither <i>maraes</i>, nor temples, nor
altars, nor offerings; and, consequently, none of the barbarous
and sanguinary rites observed at the other groups. In consequence
of this, the Samoans were considered an impious
race, and their impiety became proverbial with the people of
Rarotonga; for, when upbraiding a person who neglected
the worship of the gods, they would call him 'a godless
Samoan.' But, although heathenism was presented to us by
the Samoans in a dress different from that in which we had
been accustomed to see it, having no altars stained with
human blood, no <i>maraes</i> strewed with the skulls and bones
of its numerous victims, no sacred groves devoted to rites
of which brutality and sensuality were the most obvious
features, this people had 'lords many and gods many';&mdash;their
religious system was as obviously marked as any other
with absurdity, superstition, and vice."<a name="FNanchor_70_436" id="FNanchor_70_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_436" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>This account of the Samoan religion, written at a time
when the islands were not yet fully opened up to Europeans,
must be modified by the testimony of later writers, in
particular with regard to the alleged absence of temples and
offerings; but in its broad outlines it holds good, in so far
as the Samoan ritual was honourably distinguished from
that of many other islands in the Pacific by its freedom
from human sacrifice and from the gross and licentious
practices which prevailed in other branches of the Polynesian
race. The notion of the Rarotongans that the Samoans
were a godless people has proved to be totally mistaken.
On closer acquaintance it was found that they lived under
the influence of a host of imaginary deities who exercised
their faith and demanded their obedience. Among these
deities the most numerous and perhaps the most influential
were the <i>aitu</i>, which were the gods of individuals, of
families, of towns or villages, and of districts.<a name="FNanchor_71_437" id="FNanchor_71_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_437" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> These
gods were supposed to appear in some visible embodiment
or incarnation, and the particular thing, or class of things,
in which his god was in the habit of appearing, was to the
Samoan an object of veneration, and he took great care
never to injure it or treat it with contempt. In the great
majority of cases the thing in which the deity presented
himself to his worshippers was a class of natural objects,
most commonly a species of animal, bird, or fish, less
frequently a tree or plant or an inanimate object, such as a
stone, the rainbow, or a meteor. One man, for example,
saw his god in the eel, another in the shark, another in the
turtle, another in the owl, another in the lizard, and so on
throughout all the fish of the sea, the birds, the four-footed
beasts, and creeping things. In some of the shell-fish, such
as the limpets on the rocks, gods were supposed to be
present. It was not uncommon to see an intelligent chief
muttering prayers to a fly, an ant, or a lizard, which chanced
to alight or crawl in his presence. A man would eat freely
of the incarnation of another man's god, but would most
scrupulously refrain from eating of the incarnation of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
own particular god, believing that death would be the
consequence of such sacrilege. The offended god was
supposed to take up his abode in the body of the impious
eater and to generate there the very thing which he had
eaten, till it caused his death. For example, if a man,
whose family god was incarnate in the prickly sea-urchin
(<i>Echinus</i>), were to eat of a sea-urchin, it was believed that a
prickly sea-urchin would grow in his body and kill him.
If his family god were incarnate in the turtle, and he was
rash enough to eat a turtle, the god would enter into him,
and his voice would be heard from within the sinner's body,
saying, "I am killing this man; he ate my incarnation."
Occasionally, however, the penalty exacted by the deity was
less severe. If, for instance, a man's god was in cockles,
and he ate one of these shell-fish, a cockle would grow on his
nose; if he merely picked up a cockle on the shore and
walked away with it, the shell-fish would appear on some
part of his person. But in neither case, apparently, would
the kindly cockle take the life of the offender. It was
not a bloodthirsty deity. Again, a man whose god was in
coco-nuts would never drink the refreshing beverage which
other people were free to extract from the nuts. But the
worshipper who shrank from eating or drinking his god in
the shape, say, of an octopus or of coco-nut water, would
often look on with indifference while other people partook
of these his divinities. He might pity their ignorance or
envy their liberty, but he would not seek to enlighten the
one or to restrain the other.<a name="FNanchor_72_438" id="FNanchor_72_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_438" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Indeed this indifference was
sometimes carried to great lengths. For example, a man
whose god was incarnate in the turtle, though he would not
himself dare to partake of turtle, would have no scruple in
helping a neighbour to cut up and cook a turtle; but in
doing so he took the precaution to tie a bandage over his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
mouth to prevent an embryo turtle from slipping down his
throat and sealing his doom by growing up in his stomach.<a name="FNanchor_73_439" id="FNanchor_73_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_439" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Sometimes the incarnate deity, out of consideration perhaps
for the weakness of the flesh, would limit his presence to a
portion of an animal, it might be the left wing of a pigeon,
or the tail of a dog, or the right leg of a pig.<a name="FNanchor_74_440" id="FNanchor_74_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_440" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The
advantages of such a restriction to a worshipper are obvious.
A man, for instance, to whom it would have been death to
eat the right leg of a pig, might partake of a left leg of pork
with safety and even with gusto. And so with the rest
of the divine menagery.</p>

<p>However, even if the worst had happened, that is to say,
if the deity had been killed, cooked and eaten, the consequences
were not necessarily fatal to his worshippers; there
were modes of redeeming the lives of the sinners and of
expiating their sin. Suppose, for example, that the god of
a household was the cuttle-fish, and that some visitor to the
house had, either in ignorance or in bravado, caught a cuttle-fish
and cooked it, or that a member of the family had been
present where a cuttle-fish was eaten, the family would meet
in conclave to consult about the sacrilege, and they would
select one of their number, whether a man or a woman, to
go and lie down in a cold oven and be covered over with
leaves, just as in the process of baking, all to pretend that
the person was being offered up as a burnt sacrifice to avert
the wrath of the deity. While this solemn pretence was
being enacted, the whole family would engage in prayer,
saying, "O bald-headed cuttle-fish, forgive what has been
done. It was all the work of a stranger." If they did not
thus abase themselves before the divine cuttle-fish, they
believed that the god would visit them and cause a cuttle-fish
to grow internally in their bodies and so be the death
of some of them.<a name="FNanchor_75_441" id="FNanchor_75_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_441" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Similar modes of appeasing the wrath
of divine eels, mullets, stinging ray fish, turtles, wild pigeons,
and garden lizards were adopted with equal success.<a name="FNanchor_76_442" id="FNanchor_76_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_442" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Apparently the Samoans were even more concerned to
defend their village gods or district gods against injury and
insult than to guard the deities of simple individuals. We
are told that all the inhabitants of a district would thus
unite for the protection of the local divinity.<a name="FNanchor_77_443" id="FNanchor_77_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_443" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> For example,
it happened that in a village where the first native Christian
teachers settled one of them caught a sea-eel (<i>Muraena</i>) and
cooked it, and two of the village lads, who were their
servants, ate some of the eel for their supper. But the eel
was the village god, and when the villagers heard that the
lads had eaten the god, they administered a sound thrashing
to the culprits, and dragged them off to a cooking-house
where they laid them down in the oven pit and covered
them with leaves in the usual way, as if the lads had
been killed and were now to be cooked as a peace-offering
to avert the wrath of the deity.<a name="FNanchor_78_444" id="FNanchor_78_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_444" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> When John
Williams had caused some Christian natives to kill a large
sea-snake and dry it on the rocks to be preserved as a
specimen, the heathen fishermen of the island at sight of it
raised a most terrific yell, and, seizing their clubs, rushed upon
the Christian natives, saying, "You have killed our god!
You have killed our god!" It was with difficulty that Mr.
Williams restrained their violence on condition that the
reptile should be immediately carried back to the boat
from which the missionary had landed.<a name="FNanchor_79_445" id="FNanchor_79_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_445" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The island in
which this happened belonged to the Tongan group,
but precisely the same incident might have occurred in
Samoa. In some parts of Upolu a goddess was believed
to be incarnate in bats, and if a neighbour chanced to kill
one of these creatures, the indignant worshippers of the bat
might wage a war to avenge the insult to their deity.<a name="FNanchor_80_446" id="FNanchor_80_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_446" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> If
people who had the stinging ray fish for the incarnation of
their god heard that their neighbours had caught a fish of
that sort, they would go and beg them to give it up and not
to cook it. A refusal to comply with the request would be
followed by a fight.<a name="FNanchor_81_447" id="FNanchor_81_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_447" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, when the Samoans were converted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Christianity, they gave the strongest proof of the genuineness
of their conversion by killing and eating their animal
gods. Thus when a chief named Malietoa renounced
heathenism, he caused an eel to be publicly caught, cooked,
and eaten by many persons who had hitherto regarded the
eel as their god. His own sons had a different sort of fish,
called <i>anae</i>, for their private deity, and to demonstrate their
faith in the new religion they had a quantity of the fish
caught, cooked, and served up in the presence of a large
party of friends and relations. There, with trembling hearts,
they partook of the once sacred morsel; but, their fears
getting the better of them, they immediately retired from
the feast and swallowed a powerful emetic, lest the divine
fish should lie heavy on their stomachs and devour their
vitals.<a name="FNanchor_82_448" id="FNanchor_82_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_448" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> As nothing particular happened after these daring
innovations, the people took heart of grace, and concerted
further plans for the destruction of their ancient deities.
Among these was a certain Papo, who was nothing more
or less than a piece of old rotten matting, about three yards
long and four inches wide; but being a god of war and,
in that capacity, always attached to the canoe of the leader
when they went forth to battle, he was regarded with great
veneration by the people. At the assembly convoked to
decide on his fate, the first proposal was to throw him into
the fire. But the idea was too shocking to the general
sense of the community, and by way of making death as
little painful as possible to the deity, they decided to take
him out to sea in a canoe and there consign him to a
watery grave. Even from this mitigated doom Papo was
rescued by the efforts of the missionaries, and he now
adorns a museum.<a name="FNanchor_83_449" id="FNanchor_83_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_449" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>But even when the career of one of these animal gods
was not prematurely cut short by being killed, cooked, and
eaten, he was still liable to die in the course of nature;
and when his dead body was discovered, great was the
sorrow of his worshippers. If, for example, the god of a
village was an owl, and a dead owl was found lying beside
a road or under a tree, it would be reverently covered up
with a white cloth by the person who discovered it, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the villagers would assemble round the dead god and burn
their bodies with firebrands and beat their foreheads with
stones till the blood flowed. Then the corpse of the
feathered deity would be wrapped up and buried with as
much care and ceremony as if it were a human body.
However, that was not the death of the god. He was
supposed to be yet alive and incarnate in all the owls in
existence.<a name="FNanchor_84_450" id="FNanchor_84_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_450" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The offerings to these deities consisted chiefly of cooked
food,<a name="FNanchor_85_451" id="FNanchor_85_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_451" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> which was apparently deemed as essential to the
sustenance of gods as of men, and that even when the gods
were not animals but stones. For example, two oblong
smooth stones, which stood on a platform of loose stones
near a village, were regarded as the parents of the rain-god,
and when the people were making ready to go off to the
woods for the favourite sport of pigeon-catching, they used
to lay offerings of cooked taro and fish on the stones,
accompanied by prayers for fine weather and no rain.
These stone gods were also believed to cause yams to
grow; hence in time of dearth a man would present them
with a yam in hope of securing their favour.<a name="FNanchor_86_452" id="FNanchor_86_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_452" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>At the feasts the first cup of kava was dedicated to the
god, the presiding chief either pouring it out on the ground
or waving it towards the sky. Afterwards all the chiefs
drank from the same cup according to their rank; then the
food brought as an offering was divided and eaten there
before the god.<a name="FNanchor_87_453" id="FNanchor_87_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_453" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Even within the circle of the family it was
customary to pour out on the ground a little kava as an
offering to the family god before any one else drank of it.<a name="FNanchor_88_454" id="FNanchor_88_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_454" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Annual feasts were held in honour of the gods, and the
season of the feast was often in May, but sometimes in
April or June.<a name="FNanchor_89_455" id="FNanchor_89_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_455" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In some cases the feasts were regulated
by the appearance of the bird which was believed to be
the incarnation of the god. Whenever the bird was seen,
the priest would say that the god had come, and he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
fix upon a day for the entertainment of the deity.<a name="FNanchor_90_456" id="FNanchor_90_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_456" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> At
these festivals all the people met in the place of public
assembly, where they had collected heaps of cooked food.
First, they made their offerings to the god and prayed to
him to avert calamity and grant prosperity; then they
feasted with and before their god, and after that any
strangers present might eat. Some of the festivals included
games, such as wrestling, spear-throwing, club exercises,
sham-fights, and nocturnal dances; and they lasted for days.<a name="FNanchor_91_457" id="FNanchor_91_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_457" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
At one of these annual festivals held in the month of June,
the exercise with clubs assumed a serious and indeed
sanguinary form. All the people, old and young, men,
women, and children, took part in it, and battered their
scalps till the blood streamed down over their faces and
bodies. This proof of their devotion was supposed to be
acceptable to the deity, who, gratified by the sight of their
flowing blood, would answer their prayers for health, good
crops, and victory in war.<a name="FNanchor_92_458" id="FNanchor_92_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_458" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> At the feast of the cockle god
in May prayers were offered up to the divine shell-fish that
he would be pleased to cure the coughs and other ailments
usually prevalent at that season, which in Samoa forms the
transition from the wet to the dry months.<a name="FNanchor_93_459" id="FNanchor_93_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_459" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> At the festival
of an owl god, which fell about the month of April, the
offerings and prayers were particularly directed towards the
removal of caterpillars from the plantations; for these
insects were believed to be the servants of the owl god, who
could send them as his ministers of vengeance to lay waste
the fields and orchards of the impious.<a name="FNanchor_94_460" id="FNanchor_94_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_460" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Elsewhere the owl
was a war god, and at the beginning of the annual fish
festivals the chiefs and people of the village assembled round
the opening of the first oven and gave the first fish to the
god.<a name="FNanchor_95_461" id="FNanchor_95_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_461" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> A family, who had the eel for their household god,
showed their gratitude to him for his kindness by presenting
him with the first fruits of their taro plantation.<a name="FNanchor_96_462" id="FNanchor_96_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_462" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
Another family believed their deity to be incarnate in
centipedes; and if a member of the family fell ill or was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
bitten by a centipede, they would offer the divine reptile a
fine mat and a fan, with a prayer for the recovery of the
patient.<a name="FNanchor_97_463" id="FNanchor_97_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_463" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The utility of a fine mat and a fan to a centipede
is too obvious to be insisted on. Sometimes offerings
were made to a god, not to persuade him to come, but to
induce him to go away. For example, where gods or spirits
were believed to voyage along the coast, offerings of food
were often set down on the beach as an inducement to the
spirits to take the victuals and pass on without calling at
that particular place.<a name="FNanchor_98_464" id="FNanchor_98_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_464" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Formal prayers were offered to the god by the head of
a family, and public prayer was put up when the men were
setting out for war. On such occasions they prayed that
stones, stumps of trees, and other obstacles might be taken
out of the way of the warriors, and that their path might be
wet with the blood of their foes. All their prayers were for
temporal benefits, such as protection against enemies, plenty
of food, and other desirable objects. They attached great
importance to confession of wrongdoing in times of danger,
but, so far as appears, they expressed no repentance, promised
no amendment, and offered no prayer for forgiveness.
If, for example, a canoe, crossing the channel between
Savaii and Upolu, were caught in a squall and seemed
likely to be swamped, the steersman would head the canoe
to the wind, and every man on board would make a clean
breast of his sins. One would say, "I stole a fowl at such
and such a village." Another would confess an intrigue
with a married woman somewhere else; and so on. When
all had either confessed their guilt or declared their innocence,
the helmsman would put the helm about and scud before
the wind, in perfect confidence of bringing the canoe and
crew safe to land.<a name="FNanchor_99_465" id="FNanchor_99_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_465" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>When a god was believed to be incarnate in a species
of birds or animals or fish, omens were naturally drawn
from the appearance and behaviour of the creatures. This
happened particularly in time of war, when hopes and fears
were rife among the people. Thus, if their war god was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
owl, and the bird fluttered above the troops on the march,
the omen was good; but if the owl flew away in the direction
of the enemy, it was an evil omen, the god had deserted
them and joined the foe;<a name="FNanchor_100_466" id="FNanchor_100_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_466" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> if it crossed the path of the
warriors or flew back on them, it was a warning to retreat.<a name="FNanchor_101_467" id="FNanchor_101_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_467" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
So in places where the war-god was a rail-bird, if the bird
screeched and flew before the army, the people marched
confidently to battle; but if it turned and flew back, they
hesitated. If the plumage of the rail showed glossy red,
it was a sign to go to war; but if the feathers were dark
and dingy, it was a warning to stay at home. And if the
bird were heard chattering or scolding, as they called it, at
midnight, it prognosticated an attack next day, and they
would at once send off the women and children to a place
of safety.<a name="FNanchor_102_468" id="FNanchor_102_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_468" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In like manner omens were drawn from the
flight of herons, kingfishers, the <i>Porphyris Samoensis</i>, and
flying-foxes, where these creatures were supposed to incarnate
the war god.<a name="FNanchor_103_469" id="FNanchor_103_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_469" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> People who saw their war god in the lizard
used to take omens from a lizard before they went forth to
fight. They watched the movements of a lizard in a bundle
of spears. If the creature ran about the outside of the
bundle and the points of the spears, the omen was favourable;
but if it crept into the bundle for concealment, it was an evil
sign.<a name="FNanchor_104_470" id="FNanchor_104_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_470" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The inhabitants of several villages looked upon dogs,
especially white dogs, as the incarnation of their war god;
accordingly if the dog wagged his tail, barked, and dashed
ahead in sight of the enemy, it was a good omen; but if he
retreated or howled, their hearts failed them.<a name="FNanchor_105_471" id="FNanchor_105_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_471" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Again, where
the cuttle-fish was the war god, the movements of that fish
at sea were anxiously observed in time of war. If the fish
swam inshore while the people were mustering for battle,
it augured victory; but if it swam far away, it portended
defeat.<a name="FNanchor_106_472" id="FNanchor_106_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_472" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>When a god was supposed to dwell in some inanimate
object, the art of divination was similarly employed to elicit
a knowledge of the future from an observation of the object,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
whatever it might be. In several villages, for example, the
people viewed a rainbow as the representative of their war
god. If, when they were going to battle by land or sea, a
rainbow appeared in the sky right in front of them, with the
arch, as it were, straddling across the line of march or the
course that the fleet was steering, it was a warning to turn
back. But if the bow shone on the right or left of the army
or of the fleet, it meant that the god was marching with
them, and cheering on the advance.<a name="FNanchor_107_473" id="FNanchor_107_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_473" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Another village revered
its god in the lightning. When lightning flashed frequently
in time of war, it was believed that the god had come to
help and direct his people. A constant play of lightning
over a particular spot was a warning that the enemy was
lurking there in ambush. A rapid succession of flashes in
front meant that the foe was being driven back; but if the
lightning flashed from front to rear, it was a signal to retreat.<a name="FNanchor_108_474" id="FNanchor_108_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_474" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
In one large village the war god resided in two teeth of the
sperm whale, which were kept in a cave and observed by a
priest in time of war. If the teeth were found lying east
and west, it was a good omen; but if they lay north and
south, it prognosticated defeat.<a name="FNanchor_109_475" id="FNanchor_109_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_475" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In another place the war
god was present in a bundle of shark's teeth, and the people
consulted the bundle before they went out to fight. If the
bundle felt heavy, it foreboded ill; but if it was light, it was
an omen of victory, and the troops marched with hearts
correspondingly light.<a name="FNanchor_110_476" id="FNanchor_110_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_476" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>When the god was incarnate in a live creature, it was
an obvious advantage to ensure his constant presence and
blessing by owning a specimen of his incarnation and feeding
it. Hence some folk kept a tame god on their premises.
For instance, some people possessed a war god in the shape
of a pet owl;<a name="FNanchor_111_477" id="FNanchor_111_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_477" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> others had a divine pigeon, which was carefully
kept and fed by the different members of the family in
turn.<a name="FNanchor_112_478" id="FNanchor_112_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_478" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Yet others were so fortunate as to capture the thunder
god and to keep him in durance, which effectually prevented
him from doing mischief. Having caught him, they tied him
up with pandanus leaves and frightened him by poking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
firebrands at him. And lest, as an old offender, he should
attempt to break prison and relapse into his former career
of crime, they filled a basket with pandanus leaves and
charred firebrands and hung it up on a tree <i>in terrorem</i>, to
signify what he might expect to get if he took it into his
head to strike houses again.<a name="FNanchor_113_479" id="FNanchor_113_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_479" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Vegetable gods were much less plentiful than animal gods
in Samoa. Still they occurred. Thus, the god of one family
lived in a large tree (<i>Hernandia peltata</i>); hence no member
of the family dared to pluck a leaf or break a branch of that
tree.<a name="FNanchor_114_480" id="FNanchor_114_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_480" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The household deity of another family dwelt in a tree
of a different sort (<i>Conanga odorata</i>), which has yellow and
sweet-scented flowers.<a name="FNanchor_115_481" id="FNanchor_115_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_481" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In Savaii the special abode of a
village god called Tuifiti or "King of Fiji" was a grove of large
and durable trees (<i>Afzelia bijuga</i>). No one dared to cut that
timber. It is said that a party of natives from another island
once tried to fell one of these trees; but blood flowed from
the trunk, and all the sacrilegious strangers fell ill and died.<a name="FNanchor_116_482" id="FNanchor_116_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_482" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
One family saw their god in the moon. On the appearance
of the new moon all the members of the family called out,
"Child of the moon, you have come." They assembled also,
presented offerings of food, feasted together, and joined in
praying, "Oh, child of the moon! Keep far away disease
and death." And they also prayed to the moon before they
set out on the war path.<a name="FNanchor_117_483" id="FNanchor_117_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_483" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> But in Samoa, as in Tonga, there
seems to be no record of a worship of the sun, unless the
stories of human sacrifices formerly offered to the great
luminary be regarded as reminiscences of sun-worship.<a name="FNanchor_118_484" id="FNanchor_118_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_484" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 7. <i>Priests and Temples</i></h4>

<p>The father of a family acted as the priest of the household
god. He usually offered a short prayer at the evening
meal, begging the deity to guard them all from war, sickness,
death, and the payment of fines. Sometimes he would direct
the family to hold a feast in honour of their god, and on
these occasions a cup of kava was poured out as a libation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
to the divinity. Such simple domestic rites were celebrated
in the house, where the whole family assembled; for the
gods were believed to be present with men in a spiritual and
invisible form as well as in the material objects which were
regarded as their visible embodiments. Often the deity
spoke through the father or other members of the family,
telling them what to do in order to remove a present evil or
avert a threatened one.<a name="FNanchor_119_485" id="FNanchor_119_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_485" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>But while every head of a family might thus act as a
domestic priest and mouthpiece of the deity, there was also
a professional class of priests set apart for the public worship
of the gods, particularly of the war gods, who in their nature
did not differ essentially from the gods of families, of villages,
and of districts, being commonly embodied either in particular
material objects or in classes of such objects, especially in
various species of birds, animals, and fish, such as owls, rails,
kingfishers, dogs, lizards, flying-foxes, and cuttle-fish. Sometimes
the ruling chiefs acted as priests; but in general some
one man in a particular family claimed the dignity of the
priesthood and professed to declare the will of the god. His
office was hereditary. He fixed the days for the annual
feasts in honour of the deity, received the offerings, and
thanked the people for them. He decided also whether the
people might go to war.<a name="FNanchor_120_486" id="FNanchor_120_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_486" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The priests possessed great
authority over the minds of the people, and they often
availed themselves of their influence to amass wealth.<a name="FNanchor_121_487" id="FNanchor_121_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_487" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The
gods were supposed from time to time to take possession of
the priests and to speak through their mouths, answering
enquiries and issuing commands. Thus consulted as an
oracle the priest, or the god through him, might complain
that the people had been slack in making offerings of food
and property, and he would threaten them with vengeance
if they did not speedily bring an ample supply to the human
representative of the deity. At other times the god required
a whole family to assemble and build him a large canoe or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
house, and such a command was always obeyed with alacrity
and a humble apology tendered for past neglect. The priests
were also consulted oracularly for the healing of the sick, the
recovery of stolen property, and the cursing of enemies. Thus
they kept the people in constant fear by their threats and
impoverished them by their exactions.<a name="FNanchor_122_488" id="FNanchor_122_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_488" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The outward signs of divine inspiration or possession
were such as priests or prophets have manifested in many
lands and ages as conclusive evidence of their being the
vehicles of higher powers. The approach or presence of
the god was indicated by the priest beginning to gape, yawn,
and clear his throat; but soon his countenance changed, his
body underwent violent contortions, and in loud, unearthly
tones, which the trembling and awe-stricken hearers interpreted
as the voice of an indwelling deity, he delivered his
message of exhortation or warning, of menace, or comfort,
or hope.<a name="FNanchor_123_489" id="FNanchor_123_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_489" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Spirit-houses (<i>fale-aitu</i>) or temples were erected for some,
but not all, of the class of deities (<i>aitu</i>) which we are now
considering. It was chiefly the war gods who were thus
honoured. Such temples were built with the same materials
and in the same style as the houses of men, with nothing to
distinguish them from ordinary dwellings, except that they
almost always stood on platforms of stones, which varied in
height and size with the respect felt for the particular deity.
They were usually situated on the principal public place or
green (<i>malae</i>) of the village and surrounded by a low fence.
Sometimes they were mere huts; yet being viewed as the
abode of gods they were held sacred and regarded with great
veneration by the Samoans in the olden time. Whatever
emblems of deity were in possession of the village were
always placed in these houses under the watchful care of
keepers.<a name="FNanchor_124_490" id="FNanchor_124_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_490" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In one temple, for instance, might be seen a conch
shell hung from the roof in a basket. This shell the god
was supposed to blow when he wished the people to go to
war. In another a cup made of the shell of a coco-nut was
suspended from the roof, and before it prayers were uttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and offerings presented. The cup was also used in an ordeal
for the detection of theft. In a trial before chiefs the cup
would be sent for, and each of the suspected culprits would
lay his hand on it and say, "With my hand on this cup,
may the god look upon me, and send swift destruction,
if I took the thing which has been stolen." They firmly
believed that it would be death to touch the cup and
tell a lie.<a name="FNanchor_125_491" id="FNanchor_125_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_491" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The temples were always built by the united exertions
of a whole family, village, or district.<a name="FNanchor_126_492" id="FNanchor_126_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_492" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> For example, when
the inhabitants of a village whose god was the cuttle-fish
erected a new temple to that deity, every man, woman, and
child in the village contributed something to it, if it was only
a stick or a reed of thatch. While some of the villagers
were drafted off to put up the house, the rest engaged in a
free fight, which appears to have been considered as a necessary
part of the proceedings. On this occasion many old
scores were settled, and he who got most wounds was believed
to have earned the special favour of the deity. With the
completion of the temple the fighting ended, and ought not
to be renewed for a year, till the anniversary of the building
of the temple came round, when the worshippers were again
at liberty to break each other's heads in honour of the divine
cuttle-fish.<a name="FNanchor_127_493" id="FNanchor_127_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_493" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>At one place in Savaii there was a temple in which a
priest constantly resided. The sick used to be carried to
him in the temple and there laid down with offerings of fine
mats. Thereupon the priest stroked the diseased part, and
the patient was supposed to recover.<a name="FNanchor_128_494" id="FNanchor_128_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_494" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> We hear of another
temple in which fine mats were brought as offerings to the
priests and stored up in large numbers among the temple
treasures. Thus in time the temples might have amassed a
considerable degree of wealth and might even, if economic
progress had not been arrested by European intervention,
have developed into banks. However, when the people were
converted to Christianity, they destroyed this particular
temple and dissipated the accumulated treasures in a single<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
feast by way of celebrating their adhesion to the new
faith.<a name="FNanchor_129_495" id="FNanchor_129_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_495" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Where the bat was the local deity, many bats
used to flock about the temple in time of war.<a name="FNanchor_130_496" id="FNanchor_130_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_496" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Where
the kingfisher received the homage of the people as the
god of war, the old men of the village were wont to enter
his temple in times of public emergency and address the
kingfisher; and people outside could hear the bird replying,
though, singularly enough, his voice was that of a man, and
not that of a bird. But as usual the god was invisible.<a name="FNanchor_131_497" id="FNanchor_131_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_497" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> In
one place a temple of the great god Tangaloa was called
"the House of the Gods," and it was carefully shut up all
round, the people thinking that, if this precaution were not
taken, the gods would get out and in too easily and be all
the more destructive.<a name="FNanchor_132_498" id="FNanchor_132_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_498" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Such a temple might be considered
rather as a prison than a house of the gods.</p>

<p>To the rule that Samoan temples were built of the same
perishable materials as ordinary houses a single exception is
known. About ten miles inland from the harbour of Apia,
in the island of Upolu, are the ruins of a temple, of which
the central and side posts and the rafters were all constructed
of stone. The ground plan seems to have resembled that of
an ordinary Samoan house of the best style, forming an
ellipse which measured fifty feet in one direction by forty
feet in the other. Two central pillars appear to have supported
the roof, each fashioned of a single block of stone
some thirteen feet high, twelve inches thick one way and
nine inches the other. The rafters were in lengths of twelve
feet and six feet, by four inches square. Of the outside
pillars, which upheld the lower edge of the sloping roof,
eighteen were seen standing by Pritchard, who has described
the ruins. Each pillar stood three feet high and measured
nine inches thick in one way by six inches in the other.
Each had a notch or shoulder on the inner side for supporting
the roof. Pillars and rafters were quarried from an
adjoining bluff, distant only some fifty yards from the ruins.
Some squared stones lying at the foot of the bluff seem to
show that the temple was never completed. The site of the
ruins is a flat about three acres in area. The natives call the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
ruins <i>Fale-o-le-Fe&#8219;e</i>, that is, the House of the Fe&#8219;e. This
Fe&#8219;e was a famous war god of A&#8219;ana and Faleata, two native
towns of Upolu; he was commonly incarnated in the cuttle-fish.
As the Samoans were unacquainted with the art of
cutting stones, and had no tools suitable for the work, they
thought that this temple, with its columns and rafters of
squared stone, must have been built by the gods, and they
explained its unfinished state by alleging that the divine
builders had quarrelled among themselves before they had
brought the work to completion.<a name="FNanchor_133_499" id="FNanchor_133_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_499" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>For the sake of completeness I will mention another
stone monument, of more imposing dimensions, which has
been discovered in Samoa, though its origin and meaning
are unknown. It stands on a tableland in the high mountainous
interior of Upolu and appears to be not altogether
easy of access. The discoverer, Mr. H. B. Sterndale,
reached it by clambering up from what he describes as a
broad and dangerous ravine. In making his way to the
tableland he passed through a gap which from a distance
he had supposed to be a natural fissure in the rocks; but
on arriving at it he discovered, to his surprise, that the gap
was in fact a great fosse formed by the hand of man, being
excavated in some places and built up at others, while on
one side, next to the rise of the hill, it was further heightened
by a parapet wall. When, passing through the fosse, he
issued upon the tableland, which is a level space of some
twenty acres in extent, he perceived the monument, "a
truncated conical structure or <i>Heidenmauer</i> of such huge
dimensions as must have required the labour of a great
multitude to construct. So little did I expect," he says,
"in this neighbourhood to meet with any example of human
architecture, and so rudely monstrous was the appearance
of this cyclopean building, that from its peculiar form, and
from the vegetation with which it was overgrown, I might
have passed it by, supposing it to have been a volcanic
hillock, had not my attention been attracted by the stonework
of the fosse. I hastened to ascend it. It was about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
twenty feet high by one hundred in diameter. It was
circular with straight [perpendicular?] sides; the lower tiers
of stone were very large, they were lava blocks, some of
which would weigh at least a ton, which must have been
rolled or moved on skids to their present places. They
were laid in courses; and in two places near the top seemed
to have been entrances to the inside, as in one appeared
a low cave choked with rocks and tree roots. If there had
been chambers within, they were probably narrow and
still existing, as there was no sign of depression on the
crown of the work, which was flat and covered with flat
stones, among which grew both trees and shrubs. It is
likely that it was not in itself intended as a place of
defence, but rather as a base or platform upon which some
building of importance, perhaps of timber, had been erected,
no doubt in the centre of a village, as many foundations of
a few feet high were near it. The fosse, when unbroken,
and its inner wall entire, was probably crossed by a foot-bridge,
to be withdrawn on the approach of an enemy;
and the little gap, by which I had entered, closed, so that
this must have been a place of great security. The
Samoan natives, as far as I have been able to learn, have
no tradition of what people inhabited this mountain
fastness."<a name="FNanchor_134_500" id="FNanchor_134_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_500" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>On an adjoining tableland, approached by a steep and
narrow ridge, Mr. Sterndale saw a great number of cairns
of stone, apparently graves, disposed in rows among huge
trees, the roots of which had overturned and destroyed
very many of the cairns. Here, within the numerous
trunks of a great spreading banyan tree, Mr. Sterndale
found what he calls an inner chamber, or cell, about ten
feet square, the floor being paved with flat stones and the
walls built of enormous blocks of the same material, while
the roof was composed of the twisted trunks of the banyan
tree, which had grown into a solid arch and, festooned by
creepers, excluded even the faint glimmer of twilight that
dimly illuminated the surrounding forest. Disturbed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
a light which the traveller struck to explore the gloomy
interior, bats fluttered about his head. In the centre of
the chamber he discovered a cairn, or rather cromlech,
about four feet high, which was formed of several stones
arranged in a triangle, with a great flat slab on the top.
On the flat slab lay a large conch shell, white with age,
and encrusted with moss and dead animalculae. The
chamber or cell, enclosed by the trunks of the banyan-tree,
might have been inaccessible, if it were not that, under
the pressure of the tree-trunks, several of the great slabs
composing the wall had been displaced, leaving a
passage.<a name="FNanchor_135_501" id="FNanchor_135_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_501" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>What were these remarkable monuments? Mr. Sterndale
believed the stone chamber to be the tomb of some
man of authority in ancient days, the antiquity of the
structure being vouched for by the great banyan-tree which
had so completely overgrown it. This view is likely enough,
and is confirmed by the large number of cairns about
it, which appear to be sepulchral. But what was the
massive circular monument or platform, built of huge
blocks of lava laid in tiers? From Mr. Sterndale's
description it would seem that the structure closely
resembled the tombs of the sacred kings of Tonga, though
these tombs are oblong instead of circular. But they often
supported a house or hut of wood and thatch; and Mr.
Sterndale may well be right in supposing that the circular
Samoan monument in like manner served as a platform to
support a wooden building. In this connexion we must
not forget that the typical Samoan house was circular or
oval in contrast to the typical Tongan house, which was
oblong. The openings, which seemed to lead into the
interior of the monument, may have given access to the
sepulchral chamber where the bodies of the dead were
deposited.</p>

<p>Slight as are these indications, they apparently point to
the use of the monument as a tomb. There is nothing,
except perhaps its circular shape, to suggest that it was
a temple of the sun. As no such stone buildings have
been erected by the Samoans during the time they have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
under European observation, it may be, as Mr. Sterndale
supposed, that all the ruins described by him were the work
of a people who inhabited the islands before the arrival of
the existing race.<a name="FNanchor_136_502" id="FNanchor_136_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_502" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 8. <i>Origin of the Samoan Gods of Families, Villages,
and Districts: Relation to Totemism</i></h4>

<p>If we ask, What was the origin of the peculiar Samoan
worship of animals and other natural objects? the most
probable answer seems to be that it has been developed out
of totemism. The system is not simple totemism, for in
totemism the animals, plants, and other natural objects are
not worshipped, that is, they do not receive offerings nor
are approached with prayers; in short, they are not gods,
but are regarded as the kinsfolk of the men and women
who have them for totems. Further, the local distribution
of the revered objects in Samoa, according to villages
and districts, differs from the characteristic distribution of
totems, which is not by place but by social groups or clans,
the members of which are usually more or less intermixed
with each other in every district. It is true that in Samoa
we hear of family or household gods as well as of gods of
villages and districts, and these family gods, in so far as
they consist of species of animals and plants which the
worshippers are forbidden to kill or eat, present a close
analogy to totems. But it is to be observed that these
family gods were, so to say, in a state of unstable equilibrium,
it being always uncertain whether a man would inherit his
father's or his mother's god or would be assigned a god
differing from both of them. This uncertainty arose from
the manner of determining a man's god at birth. When
a woman was in travail, the help of several gods was
invoked, one after the other, to assist the birth; and the
god who happened to be invoked at the moment when the
child saw the light, was his god for life. As a rule, the
god of the father's family was prayed to first; so that
generally, perhaps, a man inherited the god of his father.
But if the birth was tedious and difficult, the god of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
mother's family was next invoked. When the child was
born, the mother would call out, "To whom were you
praying?" and the god prayed to just before was carefully
remembered, and his incarnation duly acknowledged throughout
the future life of the child.<a name="FNanchor_137_503" id="FNanchor_137_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_503" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Such a mode of selecting
a divine patron is totally different from the mode whereby,
under pure totemism, a person obtains his totem; for his
totem is automatically determined for him at birth, being, in
the vast majority of cases, inherited either from his father
or from his mother, without any possibility of variation
or selection. Lastly, the Samoan system differs from
most, though not all, systems of totemism, in that it is
quite independent of exogamy; in other words, there is
no rule forbidding people who revere the same god to
marry each other.</p>

<p>Thus, while the Samoan worship of certain classes of
natural objects, especially species of animals, is certainly not
pure totemism, it presents points of analogy to that system,
and might easily, we may suppose, have been developed out
of it, the feeling of kinship for totemic animals and plants
having been slowly transformed and sublimated into a
religious reverence for the creatures and a belief in their
divinity; while at the same time the clans, which were
originally intermixed, gradually sorted out from each other
and settled down in separate villages and districts. This
gradual segregation of the clans may have been facilitated
by a change from maternal to paternal descent of the
totem; for when a man transmits his totem to his offspring,
his descendants in the male line tend naturally to
expand into a local group in which the totem remains
constant from generation to generation instead of alternating
with each successive generation, as necessarily happens when
a man's children take their totem not from him but from
their mother. That the Samoan worship of <i>aitu</i> was
developed in some such way out of simple totemism appears
to have been the view of Dr. George Brown, one of our best
authorities on Samoan society and religion; for he speaks
without reserve of the revered objects as totems.<a name="FNanchor_138_504" id="FNanchor_138_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_504" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> A similar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
derivation of the Samoan <i>aitu</i> was favoured by Dr. Rivers,
who, during a visit to Samoa, found some evidence confirmatory
of this conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_139_505" id="FNanchor_139_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_505" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 9. <i>The High Gods of Samoa</i></h4>

<p>But besides these totemic gods of Samoa, as we may
term them, which were restricted in the circle of their
worshippers to particular families, villages, or districts, there
were certain superior deities who were worshipped by all the
people in common and might accordingly be called the
national divinities of Samoa; indeed the worship of some of
them was not confined to Samoa, but was shared by the
inhabitants of other groups of islands in Polynesia. These
high gods were considered the progenitors of the inferior
deities, and were believed to have formed the earth and its
inhabitants. They themselves dwelt in heaven, in the sea,
on the earth, or under the earth; but they were invisible
and did not appear to their worshippers in the form of
animals or plants. They had no temples and no priests,
and were not invoked like their descendants.<a name="FNanchor_140_506" id="FNanchor_140_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_506" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Among these high gods the chief was Tangaloa, or, as
he was sometimes called, Tangaloa-langi, that is, Tangaloa
of the Skies. He was always spoken of as the principal
god, the creator of the world and progenitor of the other
gods and of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_141_507" id="FNanchor_141_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_507" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> It is said that after existing somewhere
in space he made the heavens as an abode for himself,
and that wishing to have also a place under the heavens he
created this lower world (<i>Lalolangi</i>, that is, "Under the
heavens"). According to one account, he formed the
islands of Savaii and Upolu by rolling down two stones
from the sky; but according to another story he fished
them up from the depths of the sea on a fishing-hook.
Next he made the <i>Fee</i> or cuttle-fish, and told it to go down
under the earth; hence the lower regions of sea or land are
called <i>Sa he fee</i> or "sacred to the cuttle-fish." In its turn
the cuttle-fish brought forth all kinds of rocks, including<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the great one on which we live.<a name="FNanchor_142_508" id="FNanchor_142_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_508" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Another myth relates how
Tangaloa sent down his son or daughter in the likeness of
a bird called <i>turi</i>, a species of plover or snipe (<i>Charadrius
fulvus</i>). She flew about, but could find no resting-place, for
as yet there was nothing but ocean; the earth had not been
created or raised above the sea. So she returned to her father
in heaven and reported her fruitless search; and at last he
gave her some earth and a creeping plant. These she took
down with her on her next visit to earth; and after a time
the leaves of the plant withered and produced swarms of
worms or maggots, which gradually developed into men and
women. The plant which thus by its corruption gave birth
to the human species was the convolvulus. According to
another version of the myth, it was in reply to the complaint
of his daughter or son that the sky-god Tangaloa
fished up the first islands from the bottom of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_143_509" id="FNanchor_143_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_509" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Another of the national gods of Samoa was Mafuie, who
was supposed to dwell in the subterranean regions and to
cause earthquakes by shaking the pillar on which the earth
reposes. In a tussle with the hero Ti'iti'i, who descended
to the lower world to rob Mafuie of his fire, the earthquake
god lost one of his arms, and the Samoans considered this
as a very fortunate circumstance; for otherwise they said
that, if Mafuie had had two arms, he would have shaken the
world to pieces.<a name="FNanchor_144_510" id="FNanchor_144_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_510" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> It is said that during a shock of earthquake
the natives used to rush from their houses, throw
themselves upon the ground, gnaw the grass, and shriek in
the most frantic manner to Mafuie to desist, lest he should
shake the earth to bits.<a name="FNanchor_145_511" id="FNanchor_145_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_511" class="fnanchor">[145]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems to be doubtful whether among the Samoan
gods are to be numbered the souls of deceased ancestors.
Certainly the evidence for the practice of a worship of the
dead is far less full and clear in Samoa than in Tonga. On
this subject Dr. George Brown writes as follows: "Traces
of ancestor worship are few and indistinct. The word <i>tupua</i>
is supposed by some to mean the deified spirits of chiefs,
and to mean that they constituted a separate order from the
<i>atua</i>, who were the original gods. The word itself is the
name of a stone, supposed to be a petrified man, and is also
generally used as the name of any image having some
sacred significance, and as representing the body into which
the deified spirit was changed. What appears certain is
that ancestor worship had amongst the Samoans gradually
given place to the worship of a superior order of supernatural
beings not immediately connected with men, but
having many human passions and modes of action and life.
There are, however, some cases which seem to point to
ancestor worship in olden days, as in the case of the town
of Matautu, which is said to have been settled by a colony
from Fiji. Their principal deity was called Tuifiti, the
King of Fiji. He was considered to be the head of that
family, and a grove of trees, <i>ifilele</i> (the green-heart of India),
was sacred to him and could not be cut or injured in any
way."<a name="FNanchor_146_512" id="FNanchor_146_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_512" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> This god was supposed to be incarnate in a man
who walked about, but he was never visible to the people of
the place, though curiously enough he could be seen by
strangers.<a name="FNanchor_147_513" id="FNanchor_147_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_513" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>However, another experienced missionary, J. B. Stair,
who knew Samoa a good many years before Dr. Brown
arrived in it, speaks apparently without hesitation of the
<i>tupua</i> as being "the deified spirits of chiefs, who were also
supposed to dwell in Pulotu," where they became posts in
the house or temple of the gods. Many beautiful emblems,
he says, were chosen to represent the immortality of these
deified spirits; among them were some of the heavenly
bodies, including the Pleiades and the planet Jupiter, also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the rainbow, the marine rainbow, and many more. He adds
that the embalmed bodies of some chiefs were worshipped
under the significant title of "sun-dried gods"; and that
people prayed and poured libations of kava at the graves
of deceased relatives.<a name="FNanchor_148_514" id="FNanchor_148_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_514" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 10. <i>The Samoan Belief concerning the Human Soul:
Funeral Customs</i></h4>

<p>Whether the Samoans practised the worship of the
dead in a developed form or not, they certainly possessed
the elements out of which the worship might under favourable
circumstances be evolved. These elements are a belief
in the survival of the human soul after death, and a fear of
disembodied spirits or ghosts.</p>

<p>The Samoans believed that every man is animated by
a soul, which departs from the body temporarily in faints
and dreams and permanently at death. The soul of the
dreamer, they thought, really visited the places which he
saw in his dream. At death it departed to the subterranean
world of the dead which the Samoans called Pulotu, a name
which clearly differs only dialectically from the Tongan
Bolotoo or Bulotu. Some people professed to see the
parting soul when it had quitted its mortal body and
was about to take flight to the nether region. It was
always of the same shape as the body. Such apparitions
at the moment of death were much dreaded, and people
tried to drive them away by shouting and firing guns.
The word for soul is <i>anganga</i>, which is a reduplicated form
of <i>anga</i>, a verb meaning "to go" or "to come." Thus
apparently the Samoans did not, like many people, identify
the soul with the shadow; for in Samoan the word for
shadow is <i>ata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_149_515" id="FNanchor_149_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_515" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>However, they seem to have in a dim way associated
a man's soul with his shadow. This appears from a
remarkable custom which they observed in the case of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
unburied dead. The Samoans were much concerned for the
lot of these unfortunates and stood in great dread of their
ghosts. They believed that the spirits of those who had
not received the rites of burial wandered about wretched
and forlorn and haunted their relatives everywhere by day
and night, crying in doleful tones, "Oh, how cold! oh, how
cold!" Hence when the body of a dead kinsman was lost
because he had been drowned at sea or slain on a battlefield,
some of his relatives would go down to the seashore or
away to the battlefield where their friend had perished;
and there spreading out a cloth on the ground they would
pray to some god of the family, saying, "Oh, be kind to us;
let us obtain without difficulty the spirit of the young man!"
After that the first thing that lighted on the cloth was
supposed to be the spirit of the dead. It might be a
butterfly, a grasshopper, an ant, a spider, or a lizard;
whatever it might be, it was carefully wrapt up and taken
to the family, who buried the bundle with all due ceremony,
as if it contained the body of their departed friend. Thus
the unquiet spirit was believed to find rest. Now the insect,
or whatever it happened to be, which thus acted as proxy
at the burial was supposed to be the <i>ata</i> or shadow of the
deceased. The same word <i>ata</i> served to express likeness;
a photographer, for example, is called <i>pue-ata</i>, "shadow-catcher."
The Samoans do not appear to have associated
the soul with the breath.<a name="FNanchor_150_516" id="FNanchor_150_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_516" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>They attributed disease and death to the anger of a god,
to the agency of an evil spirit, or to the ghost of a dead
relative who had entered into the body of the sufferer.
Epilepsy, delirium, and mania were always thus explained by
the entrance into the patient of a god or demon. The
Samoan remedy for all such ailments was not medicine but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
exorcism. Sometimes a near relative of the sick person
would go round the house brandishing a spear and striking
the walls to drive away the spirit that was causing the
sickness.<a name="FNanchor_151_517" id="FNanchor_151_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_517" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Hence when a member of a family fell seriously
ill, his friends did not send for a doctor, but repaired to the
high priest of the village to enquire of him the cause of the
sickness, to learn why the family god (<i>aitu</i>) was angry with
them, and to implore his mercy and forgiveness. Often the
priest took advantage of their anxiety to demand a valuable
piece of property, such as a canoe or a parcel of ground,
as the best means of propitiating the angry deity and
so ensuring the recovery of the patient. With all these
demands the anxious and unsuspecting relatives readily
complied. But if the priest happened not to want anything
in particular at the time, he would probably tell
the messengers to gather the family about the bed of the
sufferer and there confess their sins. The command was
implicitly obeyed, and every member of the family assembled
and made a clean breast of his or her misdeeds, especially
of any curse which he or she might have called down either
on the family generally or on the invalid in particular.
Curiously enough, the curse of a sister was peculiarly
dreaded; hence in such cases the sister of the sick man was
closely questioned as to whether she had cursed him and
thus caused his illness; if so, she was entreated to remove
the curse, that he might recover. Moved by these pleadings,
she might take some coco-nut water in her mouth and
spurt it out towards or upon the body of the sufferer. By
this action she either removed the curse or declared her
innocence; a similar ceremony might be performed by any
other member of the family who was suspected of having
cursed the sick man.<a name="FNanchor_152_518" id="FNanchor_152_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_518" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>When an illness seemed likely to prove fatal, messengers
were despatched to friends at a distance that they might
come and bid farewell to the dying man. Every one who
came to visit the sufferer in his last moments brought a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
present of a fine mat or other valuable piece of property as
a token of regard, and to defray the cost of the illness and
funeral. The best of the mats would be laid on the body
of the dying man that he might have the comfort of seeing
them before he closed his eyes for ever. Dr. George Brown
thought that the spirits of the mats thus laid on the body of
the dying chief were supposed to accompany his soul to the
other world. It is possible that their spirits did so, but it
is certain that their material substance did not; for after
the funeral all the mats and other valuables so presented
were distributed among the mourners and friends assembled
on the occasion, so that every one who had brought a gift
took away something in return on his departure.<a name="FNanchor_153_519" id="FNanchor_153_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_519" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>If the dying man happened to be a chief, numbers
crowded round him to receive a parting look or word, while
in front of the house might be seen men and women wildly
beating their heads and bodies with great stones, thus
inflicting on themselves ghastly wounds, from which the
blood poured as an offering of affection and sympathy to
their departing friend or lord. It was hoped that, pleased
and propitiated by the sight of their devotion, the angry
god might yet stay his hand and spare the chief to his
people. Above all the tumult and uproar would rise the
voice of one who prayed aloud for the life then trembling in
the balance. But if the prayer seemed likely to prove
ineffectual, it was exchanged for threats and upbraiding.
"O thou shameless spirit," the voice would now be heard
exclaiming, "could I but grasp you, I would smash your
skull to pieces! Come here and let us fight together.
Don't conceal yourself, but show yourself like a man, and
let us fight, if you are angry."<a name="FNanchor_154_520" id="FNanchor_154_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_520" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after death, all the mats on the floor of the
house were thrown outside, and the thatched sides of the
house were either torn down or knocked in with clubs; while
the relatives and assembled crowds wrought themselves up
to frenzy, uttering loud shrieks, rending their garments,
tearing out their hair by handfuls, burning their bodies with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
firebrands, beating their faces and heads with clubs and
stones, or gashing themselves with shells and shark's teeth,
till the blood ran freely down. This they called an offering
of blood for the dead. In their fury some of the mourners
fell on the canoes and houses, breaking them up and tearing
them down, felling the bread-fruit trees, and devastating the
plantations of yams and taro.<a name="FNanchor_155_521" id="FNanchor_155_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_521" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>As decomposition is rapid in the hot moist climate of
Samoa, it was customary to bury commoners a few hours
after death. The body was laid out on a mat, anointed with
scented oil, and the face tinged with turmeric, to soften the
cadaverous look. It was then wound up in several folds of
native cloth and the chin propped up, the head and face
being left uncovered, while for some hours longer the body
was surrounded by weeping relatives, who kept constant
watch over it, so long as it remained in the house. These
watchers were always women, and none of them might quit
her post under any pretext till she was relieved by another.
A fire was kept burning brightly in the house all the time.
If the deceased had died of a complaint which had previously
carried off other members of the family, they would probably
open the body to "search for the disease." Any inflamed
substance which they happened to find they would take
away and burn, thinking thus to prevent any other member
of the family from being similarly afflicted. Such a custom
betrays an incipient sense of death from natural, instead of
supernatural, causes, and must have contributed to diffuse a
knowledge of human anatomy.<a name="FNanchor_156_522" id="FNanchor_156_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_522" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>So long as a corpse remained in the house no food
might be eaten under the roof; the family had their meals
outside or in another house. Those who had attended
to the deceased or handled the corpse were taboo: they
might not feed themselves or touch food with their hands.
For days they were fed by others as if they were helpless
infants. Baldness and the loss of teeth were supposed to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the punishment inflicted by the household god for a breach
of the rule. Many people fasted at such times, eating
nothing during the day, but taking a meal in the evening.
The fifth day was a day of purification. The tabooed persons
then washed their faces and hands with hot water and were
clean; after that they were free to eat at the usual time and
in the usual manner.<a name="FNanchor_157_523" id="FNanchor_157_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_523" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The ordinary mode of disposing of the dead was by
interment either in a stone vault or in a shallow grave. But
occasionally other modes were adopted, such as embalming,
putting the corpse in a canoe and setting it adrift on the sea,
or exposing it on a stage erected in the forest, where it was
left to decay, the bones being afterwards collected and buried.
Upon the death of a chief his body was generally deposited in
a family vault, the sides and bottom of which were lined with
large slabs of sandstone or basalt, while another large slab of
the same material formed the roof. Such vaults were sometimes
large and massive. The stones used in their construction
were found in various parts of the islands. Commoners
were buried in shallow graves.<a name="FNanchor_158_524" id="FNanchor_158_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_524" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Ordinary people were usually buried the day after they
died. As many friends as could be present attended the
funeral. Every one brought a present, but on the day after
the funeral all these presents, like those which had previously
been made to the dying man, were distributed again, so that
none went empty-handed away. The corpse was generally
buried without a coffin; but chiefs were laid in hollow logs
or canoes. However, even the bodies of common people
were sometimes interred in rude coffins similarly constructed.
There were no common burying-grounds; all preferred to
bury their dead on their own land. Often the grave was
dug close to the house. The body was laid in it with the
head to the east and the feet to the west. When it had
been thus committed to its last resting-place, a near relative
of the deceased, a sister, if one survived, seated herself at the
grave, and waving a white cloth over the corpse, began an
address to the dead. "Compassion to you," she said, "go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
with goodwill, and without bearing malice towards us. Take
with you all our diseases, and leave us life." Then pointing
to the west, she exclaimed, "Misery there!" Next pointing
to the east, she cried, "Prosperity there!" Lastly, pointing
to the grave, she said, "Misery there; but leave happiness
with us!" With the body they deposited in the grave
several things which had been used by the deceased during
his illness, such as his clothing, his drinking-cup, and his
bamboo pillow. The wooden pickaxes and coco-nut shells
employed as shovels in digging the grave were also carefully
buried with the corpse. It was not, we are told, because the
people believed these things to be of use to the dead; but
because it was supposed that, if they were left and handled
by others, further disease and death would be the consequence.
Valuable mats and other articles of property were
sometimes buried with the corpse, and the grave of a warrior
was surrounded with spears stuck upright in the ground.
Graves were sometimes enclosed with stones and strewn
with sand or crumbled coral.<a name="FNanchor_159_525" id="FNanchor_159_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_525" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The obsequies of a chief of high rank were more
elaborate. The body was kept unburied for days until his
clansfolk had assembled from various parts of the islands
and paraded the body, shoulder high, through the village,
chanting a melancholy dirge.<a name="FNanchor_160_526" id="FNanchor_160_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_526" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The mourning and ceremonies
lasted from ten to fifteen days. All that time the house of
death was watched night and day by men appointed for the
purpose. After the burial, and until the days of mourning
were ended, the daytime was generally spent in boxing and
wrestling matches, and sham-fights, while the nights were
occupied with dancing and practising a kind of buffoonery,
which was customary at these seasons of mourning for the
dead. The performance was called <i>O le tau-pinga</i>. The
performers amused themselves by making a variety of
ludicrous faces and grimaces at each other, to see who
could excite the other to laugh first. Thus they whiled
away the hours of night till the days of mourning were
expired.<a name="FNanchor_161_527" id="FNanchor_161_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_527" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> So long as the funeral ceremonies and feasts lasted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
no work might be done in the village, and no strangers
might approach it. The neighbouring lagoon and reefs were
taboo: no canoe might pass over the lagoon anywhere near
the village, and no man might fish in it or on the reef.<a name="FNanchor_162_528" id="FNanchor_162_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_528" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
For a chief or man of distinction fires were kept burning
day and night in a line from the house to the grave; these
fires were maintained for ten days after the funeral. The
reason assigned for this custom, according to Ella, was to
keep away evil spirits. Even common people observed a
similar custom. After burial they kept a fire blazing in
the house all night, and they were careful to clear the
intervening ground so that a stream of light went forth from
the house to the grave. The account which the Samoans
gave of the custom, according to Turner, was that it was
merely a light burning in honour of the departed, and a
mark of their tender regard for him. Dr. George Brown
believed that the original motive for the custom was to warm
the ghost, and probably at the same time to protect the
mourners against dangerous spirits.<a name="FNanchor_163_529" id="FNanchor_163_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_529" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The head was deemed a very sacred part, and in olden
days the bodies of chiefs were often buried near their houses
until decomposition had set in, when the head was cut off
and interred in some family burying-place inland, to save
it from insult in time of war. This interment of the head
was accompanied with feasts, dances, and sham-fights. The
skull was borne to the appointed place on a kind of stage,
attended by a troop of armed men. With these sham-fights
Dr. George Brown, who records the custom, compares
the sham-fights which used to take place among the
Melanesians of the Duke of York Island when the body of
a chief was laid on a high platform in front of his house,
one company of warriors striving to deposit the corpse
on the platform, while their adversaries attempted to
prevent them from doing so.<a name="FNanchor_164_530" id="FNanchor_164_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_530" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The meaning of these
curious sham-fights is obscure. Perhaps the attacking
party represented a band of evil spirits, who endeavoured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
to snatch away the chief's body, but were defeated in the
nefarious attempt.</p>

<p>One or two families of chiefs in the island of Upolu used
to practise a rude kind of embalming. The work was done
exclusively by women. The viscera having been removed
and buried, the women anointed the body daily with a
mixture of oil and aromatic juices. To let the fluids
escape, they punctured the body all over with fine needles.
Finally, wads of native cloth, saturated with oil or resinous
gums, were inserted in the abdomen, the apertures were
closed up, and the body wrapt in native cloth. The face,
hands, and feet were left exposed, and were repeatedly
anointed with oil, mixed with turmeric powder, to give a
fresh and life-like appearance to the mummy. The whole
process lasted about two months. On its completion the
mummy was placed in a house built specially for the purpose,
where, loosely covered with a sheet of native cloth, it rested
on a raised platform. Strangers were freely admitted to see
it. Four of these mummies, laid out in a house, were to be
seen down to about the year 1864. They were the bodies
of a chief, his wife, and two sons. Dr. George Turner
judged that they must have been embalmed upwards of
thirty years, and although they had been exposed all that
time, they were in a remarkably good state of preservation.
The people assigned no particular reason for the practice,
further than that it sprang from an affectionate desire to
keep the bodies of their departed friends with them, as if
they were still alive.<a name="FNanchor_165_531" id="FNanchor_165_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_531" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 11. <i>The Fate of the Human Soul after Death</i></h4>

<p>With regard to the fate of human souls after death the
Samoans appear to have believed in their immortality, or
at all events in their indefinite survival. On this subject
Dr. Brown observes: "All souls survived after death, and
so far as I know they had no idea of their dying a second
death or being destroyed. I do not think that a Samoan
could give any reason for his belief that the soul does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
perish with the body, but he certainly does believe this, and
I never heard any one question the fact."<a name="FNanchor_166_532" id="FNanchor_166_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_532" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Thus, according
to Dr. Brown the Samoans, unlike the Tongans, drew no
invidious distinction between the souls of noblemen and the
souls of commoners, but liberally opened the doors of
immortality to gentle and simple alike. So far, they carried
their republican or democratic spirit into the world beyond
the grave.</p>

<p>However, according to the American ethnologist, Horatio
Hale, some of the Samoans agreed with the Tongans in
taking an aristocratic view of the destiny of souls after
death; and as he had good opportunities for acquainting
himself with the Samoan religion during the prolonged
stay of the American Exploring Expedition at Samoa
in 1839, when the islands were as yet but little affected
by European influence, I will quote his account. He
says: "All believe in the existence of a large island,
situated far to the north-west called <i>Pul&oacute;tu</i>, which is the
residence of the gods. Some suppose that while the souls
of the common people perish with their bodies, those of the
chiefs are received into this island, which is described as
a terrestrial elysium, and become there inferior divinities.
Others hold (according to Mr. Heath) that the spirits of the
departed live and work in a dark subterraneous abode, and
are eaten by the gods. A third, and very common opinion
is, that the souls of all who die on an island, make their way
to the western extremity, where they plunge into the sea;
but what then becomes of them is not stated. The rock
from which they leap, in the island of Upolu, was pointed
out to us; the natives term it '<i>Fatu-asofia</i>,' which was
rendered the 'jumping-off stone.'"<a name="FNanchor_167_533" id="FNanchor_167_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_533" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Of these various opinions described by Hale the third
would seem to have been by far the most prevalent. It was
commonly believed that the disembodied spirit retained the
exact resemblance of its former self, by which we are probably
to understand the exact resemblance of its former
body. Immediately on quitting its earthly tabernacle it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
began its solitary journey to Fafa, which was the subterranean
abode of the dead, lying somewhere to the west of
Savaii, the most westerly island of the group. Thus, if a
man died in Manua, the most easterly of the islands, his soul
would journey to the western end of that island, then dive
into the sea and swim across to Tutuila. There it would
walk along the beach to the extreme westerly point of the
island, when it would again plunge into the sea and swim
across to the next island, and so on to the most westerly
cape of Savaii, where it finally dived into the ocean and
pursued its way to the mysterious Fafa.<a name="FNanchor_168_534" id="FNanchor_168_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_534" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>At the western end of Savaii, near the village of
Falealupo, there are two circular openings among the rocks,
not far from the beach. Down these two openings the souls
of the dead were supposed to go on their passage to the
spirit-world. The souls of chiefs went down the larger of
the openings, and the souls of common people went down
the smaller. Near the spot stood a coco-nut tree, and if a
passing soul chanced to collide with it, the soul could not
proceed farther, but returned to its body. When a man
recovered from a deep swoon, his friends supposed that his
soul had been arrested in its progress to the other world by
knocking against the coco-nut tree, and they rejoiced, saying,
"He has come back from the tree of the Watcher," for that
was the name by which the coco-nut tree was known. So
firmly did the people of the neighbourhood believe in the
passage of the souls near their houses, that at night they
kept down the blinds to exclude the ghosts.<a name="FNanchor_169_535" id="FNanchor_169_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_535" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The "jumping-off
stone" at the west end of Upolu was also dreaded on
account of the passing ghosts. The place is a narrow rocky
cape. The Samoans were much astonished when a Christian
native boldly built himself a house on the haunted spot.<a name="FNanchor_170_536" id="FNanchor_170_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_536" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
According to one account, the souls of the dead had not to
make their way through the chain of islands by the slow
process of walking and swimming, but were at once transported
to the western end of Savaii by a band of spirits,
who hovered over the house of the dying man, and catching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
up his parting spirit conveyed it in a straight course
westward.<a name="FNanchor_171_537" id="FNanchor_171_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_537" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The place down which the spirits of the dead were
supposed to descend to the nether world was called by a
native name (<i>Lua&#333;</i>), which means "hollow pit." "May you
go rumbling down the hollow pit" was a common form of
cursing. At the bottom of the pit was a running stream
which floated the spirits away to Pulotu. All alike, the
handsome and the ugly, old and young, chiefs and
commoners, drifted pell-mell on the current in a dazed, semi-conscious
state, till they came to Pulotu. There they bathed
in "the Water of Life" and recovered all their old life and
vigour. Infirmity of every kind fled away; even the aged
became young again. The underworld of Pulotu was conceived
on the model of our upper world. There, as here,
were heavens and earth and sea, fruits and flowers; there
the souls of the dead planted and fished and cooked; there
they married and were given in marriage, all after the
manner of life on earth.<a name="FNanchor_172_538" id="FNanchor_172_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_538" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>However, it appears that according to a widespread
belief the world of the dead was sharply discriminated into
two regions, to wit, an Elysium or place of bliss called
Pulotu, and a Tartarus or place of woe named S&#257;-le-Fe'e.
The title for admission to one or other of these places was
not moral worth but social rank, chiefs going to Elysium
and commoners to Tartarus. The idea of the superiority of
the chiefs to the common people was thus perpetuated in
the land of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_173_539" id="FNanchor_173_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_539" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The king of the lower regions was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
a certain Saveasiuleo, that is, Savea of the Echo. He reclined
in a house in the company of the chiefs who gathered
round him: the upper part of his body was human, the
lower part was like that of a fish and stretched away into
the sea. This royal house of assembly was supported by
the erect bodies of chiefs, who had been of high rank on
earth, and who, before they died, anticipated with pride the
honour they were to enjoy by serving as pillars in the
temple of the King of Pulotu.<a name="FNanchor_174_540" id="FNanchor_174_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_540" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>But the souls of the dead were not permanently confined
to the lower world. They could return to the land of the
living by night to hold converse with members of their
families, to warn and instruct them in dreams, and to foretell
the future. They could cause disease and death by entering
into the bodies of their enemies and even of their friends, and
they produced nightmare by sitting on the chests of sleepers.
They haunted some houses and especially burying-grounds.
Their apparitions were visible to the living and were greatly
dreaded; people tried to drive them away by shouts, noises,
and the firing of guns. But the ghosts had to return to the
nether world at daybreak. It was because they feared the
spirits of the dead that the Samoans took such great pains
to propitiate dying people with presents; this they did
above all to persons whom they had injured, because they
had most reason to dread the anger of their ghosts.<a name="FNanchor_175_541" id="FNanchor_175_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_541" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> However,
the souls of the departed were also thought of in a
more amiable light; they could help as well as harm mankind.
Hence prayers were commonly offered at the grave
of a parent, a brother, or a chief. The suppliant, for
example, might pray for health in sickness; or, if he were
of a malignant turn, he might implore the ghost to compass
the death of some person at whom he bore a grudge. Thus
we are told that a woman prayed for the death of her
brother, and he died accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_176_542" id="FNanchor_176_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_542" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> In such beliefs and
practices we have, as I have already observed, the essential
elements of a regular worship of the dead. Whether the
Samoans were on the way to evolve such a religion or, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Dr. George Brown preferred to suppose,<a name="FNanchor_177_543" id="FNanchor_177_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_543" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> had left it behind
them and made some progress towards a higher faith, we
hardly possess the means of determining.</p>

<p>But while the Samoans thought that the dead return to
earth to make or mar the living, they did not believe that
the spirits come back to be born again in the form of men
or animals or to occupy inanimate bodies; in other words
they had no belief in the transmigration of souls.<a name="FNanchor_178_544" id="FNanchor_178_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_544" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The
absence of such a belief is significant in view of Dr. Rivers's
suggestion that Melanesian totemism may have been evolved
out of a doctrine of metempsychosis, human souls being
supposed to pass at death into their totem animals or plants.<a name="FNanchor_179_545" id="FNanchor_179_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_545" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
We have seen that the Samoan system of family, village,
and district gods bears strong marks of having been developed
out of totemism; and if their totemism had in turn
been developed out of a doctrine of transmigration, we
should expect to find among them a belief that the souls of
the dead appeared in the shape of the animals, plants, or
other natural objects which were regarded as the embodiments
of their family, village, or district gods. But of such
a belief there is seemingly no trace. It appears, therefore,
unlikely that Samoan totemism was based on a doctrine of
transmigration. Similarly we have seen reason to think
that the Tongan worship of animals may have sprung
from totemism, though according to the best authorities
that worship was not connected with a theory of metempsychosis.<a name="FNanchor_180_546" id="FNanchor_180_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_546" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
Taken together, the Samoan and the Tongan
systems seem to show that, if totemism ever flourished
among the Polynesians, it had not its roots in a worship
of the dead.</p>

Stewart, in those parts of Hawaii to
which the influence of the missionaries
had not penetrated, two-thirds of the
infants born were murdered by their
parents within the age of two years.
In Tahiti three women, questioned by
Mr. Williams, acknowledged that they
had killed twenty-one of their children
between them. Another, at the point
of death, confessed to him, in an
anguish of remorse, that she had destroyed
sixteen of her children.</p></div>

there is no clear explanation of the
custom of sprinkling coco-nut water as
a purificatory rite. But the explanation
given by Stair, which I have quoted in
the text, is clear and satisfactory, and
elsewhere (p. 285) Dr. Brown implicitly
adopts the same explanation, where he
says that the man who had served kava
to a sacred chief "sprinkled himself
all over to wash away the sacredness
(<i>paia</i>)."</p></div>

whether the Samoans held a doctrine
of moral retribution after death, Dr.
Brown observes: "I do not remember
any statement to the effect that the
conduct of a man in this life affected
his state after death. They certainly
believe this now, but whether they
did so prior to the introduction of
Christianity I cannot definitely say. I
am inclined, however, to believe that
they did not believe that conduct in
this life affected them in the future"
(<i>Melanesians and Polynesians</i>, pp.
261 <i>sq.</i>). Elsewhere, however, Dr.
Brown seems to express a contrary
opinion. He says: "It was generally
understood that the conditions of men
in this life, even amongst the common
people, had an effect on their future
conditions. A good man in Samoa
generally meant a liberal man, one who
was generous and hospitable; whilst a
bad man was one who was mean, selfish,
and greedy about food" (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 222).</p></div>

<h3>THE BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY AMONG THE HERVEY ISLANDERS</h3>


<h4>&sect; 1. <i>The Hervey or Cook Islands</i></h4>

<p>The Hervey or Cook Archipelago is a scattered group
of nine small islands situated in the South Pacific about
seven hundred miles south-east of Samoa. The islands are
either volcanic or coralline, and approach to them is impeded
by dangerous reefs and the absence of harbours.<a name="FNanchor_1_547" id="FNanchor_1_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_547" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
two principal islands are Rarotonga and Mangaia, the most
southerly of the group. Of these the larger, Rarotonga, has
a circumference of about thirty miles. It is a vast mass of
volcanic mountains, rising peak above peak, to a height of
between four and five thousand feet above the sea; but from
the foot of the mountains a stretch of flat land, covered with
rich alluvial soil, extends for one or two miles to the coast,
which is formed by a fringing reef of live coral. The
whole island is mantled in luxuriant tropical verdure. It
is difficult, we are told, to exaggerate the strange forms of
beauty which everywhere meet the eye in this lovely island:
gigantic and fantastic columns of rock draped with vines;
deep valleys lying in the shadow of overhanging mountains;
primaeval forest with its many shades of green; immense
chestnut trees, laden with fragrant blossoms; miles of bread-fruit
groves, intermingled with coco-nut palms; and nearer
the beach plantains, bananas, sweet potatoes, and lastly,
growing to the water's edge, graceful iron-wood trees with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
hair-like leaves drooping like tresses, all contribute to the
variety and charm of the scenery.<a name="FNanchor_2_548" id="FNanchor_2_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_548" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Very different is the aspect of Mangaia. It is a
complete coral island rising from deep water as a ring of
live coral; there is no lagoon. A few hundred yards inland
from the rugged beach there rises gradually a second or
inner ring of dead coral, which towards the interior falls
away perpendicularly, thus surrounding the island like a
cyclopean wall. This belt or bulwark of dead coral is from
one to two miles wide. To cross it is like walking on
spear-points: to slip and fall on it may entail ghastly
wounds. The streams of water from the interior find their
way through it to the sea by subterranean channels.
Imbedded in the highest parts of this inland reef of coral
are many sea-shells of existing species, and it is honeycombed
with many extensive caves, which were formerly used as
dwellings, cemeteries, places of refuge, or storehouses. Scores
of them are filled with desiccated human bodies. So vast
are they that it is dangerous to venture alone into their
recesses; the forlorn wanderer might never emerge from them
again. Some of them are said to penetrate far under the
bed of the ocean. In these caverns stalactite and stalagmite
abound, forming thick and fast-growing layers of limestone
rock. The largest and most famous of the caves is known
as the Labyrinth (<i>Tuatini</i>). The interior of the island is
formed of dark volcanic rock and red clay, descending in low
hills from a flat-topped centre, called the Crown of Mangaia.
The summit is not more than six hundred and fifty feet
above the level of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_3_549" id="FNanchor_3_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_549" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 2. <i>The Islanders and their Mode of Life</i></h4>

<p>Though the natives speak a Polynesian language closely
akin to the Samoan and have legends of their migration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
from Samoa, they appear not to be pure Polynesians. They
say that they found black people on Rarotonga; and their
more pronounced features, more wavy hair, darker complexion,
and more energetic character seem to indicate an
admixture of Melanesian blood. In Mangaia, indeed, this
type is said to predominate, the natives of that island being
characterised by dusky brown skin, wavy or frizzly hair, and
ample beards: their features, too, are more prominent than
those of the Rarotongans, and their manners are wilder.<a name="FNanchor_4_550" id="FNanchor_4_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_550" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Cannibalism prevailed in most of the islands of the group
down to the conversion of the natives to Christianity, which
took place between 1823 and 1834, when, with the exception
of a few pagans in Mangaia, there did not remain a
single idolater, or vestige of idolatry, in any one of the
islands. However, many years afterwards old men, who had
partaken of cannibal feasts, assured a missionary that human
flesh was far superior to pork.<a name="FNanchor_5_551" id="FNanchor_5_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_551" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In the larger islands the natives cultivated the soil
diligently even before their contact with Europeans. The
missionary John Williams, who discovered Rarotonga in 1823,
found the island in a high state of cultivation. Rows of
superb chestnut trees (<i>inocarpus</i>), planted at equal distances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
stretched from the base of the mountains to the sea, while
the spaces between the rows, some half a mile wide, were
divided into taro patches, each about half an acre in extent,
carefully banked up and capable of being irrigated at pleasure.
On the tops of the banks grew fine bread-fruit trees placed
at equal intervals, their stately foliage presenting a pleasing
contrast to the pea-green leaves of the ordinary taro and
the dark colour of the giant taro (<i>kape</i>) in the beds and on
the sloping banks beneath.<a name="FNanchor_6_552" id="FNanchor_6_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_552" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In Rarotonga bread-fruit and
plantains are the staple food; in Mangaia it is taro. On
the atolls the coco-nut palm flourishes, but no planting can
be done, as the soil consists of sand and gravel thrown up
by the sea on the ever-growing coral. The inhabitants of
the atolls live contentedly on coco-nuts and fish; they are
expert fishermen, having little else to do. But fresh fish are
also eaten in large quantities on most of the islands.<a name="FNanchor_7_553" id="FNanchor_7_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_553" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In
some of the islands the planting was done by the women,
but in others, including Rarotonga, the taro was both planted
and brought home by the men. Women cooked the food
in ovens of hot stones sunk in holes, and they made cloth
from the bark of the paper-mulberry, which they stripped
from the tree, steeped in water, and beat out with square
mallets of iron-wood. But garments were made also from
the inner bark of the banyan and bread-fruit trees.<a name="FNanchor_8_554" id="FNanchor_8_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_554" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In the
old days the native houses were flimsy quadrangular huts
constructed of reeds and thatched with plaited leaflets of
the coco-nut palm, which were very pervious to rain; but
the temples and large houses of chiefs were thatched with
pandanus leaves. The doors were always sliding; the
threshold was made of a single block of timber, tastefully
carved. There was a sacred and a common entrance.<a name="FNanchor_9_555" id="FNanchor_9_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_555" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Like
all the Polynesians, the Hervey Islanders before their discovery
were ignorant of the metals. When in a wrecked
vessel they found a bag of Californian gold, they thought it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
was something good to eat and proceeded to cook the
nuggets in order to make them juicy and tender.<a name="FNanchor_10_556" id="FNanchor_10_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_556" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 3. <i>Social Life: the Sacred Kings</i></h4>

<p>The people were divided into tribes or clans, each tracing
descent in the male line from a common ancestor, and each
possessing its own lands, which were inalienable. Exogamy,
we are told, was the universal rule in the olden time; but
when a tribe was split up in war, the defeated portion was
treated as an alien tribe. Polygamy was very common, and
was not restricted to chiefs. A man often had two or three
sisters to wife at the same time. Distant cousins sometimes,
though rarely, married each other; but in such cases they
had to belong to the same generation; that is, they must be
descended in the same degree, fourth, fifth, or even more
remote, from the common ancestor. If misfortune or disease
overtook couples linked even by so distant a relationship, the
elders would declare that it was brought upon them by the
anger of the clan-god. It was the duty of parents to teach
their growing children whom they might lawfully marry, but
their choice was extremely limited. Children as a rule
belonged to the tribe or clan of their father, unless they
were adopted into another. However, parents had it at
their option to assign a child at birth either to the tribe of its
father or to the tribe of its mother; this they did by pronouncing
over the infant the name either of the father's or of
the mother's god. Commonly the father had the preference;
but occasionally, when the father's tribe was one from which
human victims for sacrifice were regularly drawn, the mother
would seek to save the child's life by having the name
of her tribal god pronounced over it and so adopting
it into her own tribe.<a name="FNanchor_11_557" id="FNanchor_11_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_557" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Circumcision in an imperfect form
was practised in the Hervey Islands from time immemorial.
It was usually performed on a youth about the age of sixteen.
The operation was indispensable to marriage. No woman
would knowingly marry an uncircumcised husband. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
greatest insult that could be offered to a man was to accuse
him of being uncircumcised. The rite is said to have been
invented by the god Rongo in order to seduce the beautiful
wife of his brother Tangaroa, and he enjoined the observance
of circumcision upon his worshippers.<a name="FNanchor_12_558" id="FNanchor_12_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_558" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In Rarotonga it was
customary to mould a child's head into a high shape by
pressing the forehead and the back of the head between slabs
of soft wood. This practice did not obtain on Mangaia nor,
apparently, on any other island of the Hervey Group.<a name="FNanchor_13_559" id="FNanchor_13_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_559" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In Rarotonga four ranks of society were recognised. These
were the <i>ariki</i>, or king; the <i>mataiapo</i>, or governors of districts;
the <i>rangatira</i>, or landowners; and the <i>unga</i>, or tenants.
A man was accounted great according to the number of his
<i>kaingas</i> or farms, which contained from one to five acres.
These were let to tenants, who, like vassals under the feudal
system, obeyed the orders of their superior, assisted him in
erecting his house, in building his canoe, in making fishing-nets,
and in other occupations, besides bringing him a certain
portion of the produce of his lands.<a name="FNanchor_14_560" id="FNanchor_14_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_560" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The kings were sacred men, being regarded as priests
and mouthpieces of the great tutelary divinities.<a name="FNanchor_15_561" id="FNanchor_15_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_561" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In
Mangaia they were the priests or mouthpieces of the
great god Rongo. So sacred were their royal persons that
no part of their body might be tattooed: they might not
take part in dances or in actual warfare. Peace could not
be proclaimed nor blood spilt lawfully without the consent
of the king speaking in the name of the god Rongo. Quite
distinct from, and subordinate to, the sacred king was the
"lord of Mangaia," a warrior chief who gained his lordship
by a decisive victory. He represented the civil power, while
the king represented the spiritual power; but while the
office of the king was hereditary, the office of the civil lord was
not. It sometimes happened that the civil lord was at enmity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
with the king of his day. In that case the king would refuse to
complete the ceremonies necessary for his formal investiture;
life would remain unsafe; the soil could not be cultivated,
and famine soon ensued. This state of turbulence and
misery might last for years, till the obnoxious chief had been
in his turn despatched, and a more agreeable successor
appointed.<a name="FNanchor_16_562" id="FNanchor_16_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_562" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Thus the sacred king and the civil lord corresponded
to the Tooitonga or sacred chief and the civil king
of Tonga.<a name="FNanchor_17_563" id="FNanchor_17_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_563" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 4. <i>Religion, the Gods, Traces of Totemism</i></h4>

<p>Yet though the king of Mangaia ranked above the civil
or temporal lord, it devolved on that lord to install a new
king in office by formally seating him on "the sacred sandstone"
(<i>te kea inamoa</i>) in the sanctuary or sacred grove
(<i>marae</i>)<a name="FNanchor_18_564" id="FNanchor_18_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_564" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of Rongo on the sea-shore facing the setting sun.
The ceremony took place in presence of the leading
under-chiefs. The special duty of the king was by offering
rhythmical and very ancient prayers to Great Rongo to
keep away evil-minded spirits who might otherwise injure
the island. For this end the principal king (<i>te ariki pa uta</i>)
lived in the interior of the island in the sacred and fertile
district of Keia. His prayers were thought to avert evil
spirits coming from the east. On the barren sea-shore
at O-rongo (the seat of the temple or grove of Rongo)
lived the secondary king (<i>te ariki pa tai</i>), who warded
off bad spirits coming from the west. Besides this primary
ghostly function, many other important duties devolved
upon these royal personages. The secondary or shore
king was not infrequently a natural son of the great inland
king. By virtue of their office all kings were high priests
of Rongo, the tutelary god of Mangaia.<a name="FNanchor_19_565" id="FNanchor_19_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_565" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>But Rongo was not peculiar to the Hervey Islands. He
was a great Polynesian deity worshipped in almost every
part of the Pacific, and though his attributes differed greatly
in different places, a universal reverence was paid to him.
In the Hervey Islands, he and his twin brother Tangaroa were
deemed the children of Vatea, the eldest of the primary gods,
a being half man and half fish, whose eyes are the sun and
the moon. The wife of this monstrous deity and mother
of the divine twins was Papa, whose name signifies Foundation
and who was supposed to be a daughter of Timatekore
or "Nothing-more." The twin Tangaroa, another great
Polynesian deity, was specially honoured in Rarotonga and
Aitutaki, another of the Hervey Islands.<a name="FNanchor_20_566" id="FNanchor_20_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_566" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The famous
Polynesian hero Maui was also well known in the Hervey
Islands, where people told how he had brought up the first
fire to men from the under world, having there wrested it
from the fire-god Mauike;<a name="FNanchor_21_567" id="FNanchor_21_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_567" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> how he raised the sky&mdash;a solid
vault of blue stone&mdash;to its present height, for of old the sky
almost touched the earth, so that people could not walk
upright;<a name="FNanchor_22_568" id="FNanchor_22_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_568" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and finally how he caught the great sun-god Ra
himself in six nooses made of strong coco-nut fibre, so
that the motions of the orb of day, which before had been
extremely irregular, have been most orderly ever since.<a name="FNanchor_23_569" id="FNanchor_23_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_569" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>But besides the divine or heroic figures of more or less
anthropomorphic type, which the Hervey Islanders recognised
in common with the rest of the Polynesians, we may
distinguish in their mythology traces of that other and
probably older stage of thought in which the objects of
religious reverence are rather animals than men or beings
modelled in the image of man. We have seen that this
early stage of religion was well preserved in Samoa down to
the time when the islands fell under the observation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Europeans, and that it was probably a relic of totemism,<a name="FNanchor_24_570" id="FNanchor_24_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_570" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
which at an earlier period may perhaps have prevailed generally
among the ancestors of the Polynesians. In the Hervey
Islands there was a god called Tonga-iti, who appeared
visibly in the form of black and white spotted lizards.<a name="FNanchor_25_571" id="FNanchor_25_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_571" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Another deity named Tiaio took possession of the body of
the large white shark, the terror of these islanders, and he
had a small sacred grove (<i>marae</i>) set apart for his worship.
It is said that this shark-god was a former king of Mangaia,
who in the pride of his heart had defiled the sacred district
of Keia, the favourite haunt of the gods, by wearing some
beautiful scarlet hibiscus flowers in his ears. Now anything
red was forbidden in that part of the island as being offensive
to the gods; and even the beating of bark-cloth was prohibited
there, lest the repose of the gods should be disturbed
by the noise. Hence an angry priest knocked the proud and
impious king on the head, and the blood of the slain monarch
flowed into a neighbouring stream, where it was drunk by a
great fresh-water eel. So the spirit of the dead king entered
into the eel, but subsequently, pursuing its way to the sea,
the spirit forsook the eel and took possession of the shark.<a name="FNanchor_26_572" id="FNanchor_26_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_572" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Nevertheless he continued occasionally to appear to his
worshippers in the form of an eel; for we are told that in
the old heathen days, if a huge eel were caught in a net, it
would have been regarded as the god Tiaio himself come on
a visit, and that it would accordingly have been allowed to
return to the water unmolested.<a name="FNanchor_27_573" id="FNanchor_27_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_573" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It is quite possible that
this derivation of the eel-god or shark-god from a former
king of Mangaia may be historically correct; for we are told
that "many of the deities worshipped in the Hervey Group
and other islands of the eastern Pacific were canonised
priests, kings, and warriors, whose spirits were supposed to
enter into various birds, fish, reptiles, insects, etc., etc.
Strangely enough, they were regarded as being, in no respect,
inferior to the original deities."<a name="FNanchor_28_574" id="FNanchor_28_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_574" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Among the creatures in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
which gods, and especially the spirits of deified men, were
believed permanently to reside or to be incarnate were
reckoned sharks, sword-fish, eels, the octopus, yellow and
black spotted lizards, as well as several kinds of birds and
insects.<a name="FNanchor_29_575" id="FNanchor_29_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_575" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In Rarotonga the cuttle-fish was the special deity
of the reigning family down to the subversion of paganism.<a name="FNanchor_30_576" id="FNanchor_30_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_576" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
In Mangaia the tribe of Teipe, whose members were liable to
serve as victims in human sacrifices, worshipped the centipede:
there was a shrine of the centipede god at Vaiau on
the eastern side of Mangaia.<a name="FNanchor_31_577" id="FNanchor_31_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_577" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Again, two gods, Tekuraaki
and Utakea, were supposed to be incarnate in the woodpecker.<a name="FNanchor_32_578" id="FNanchor_32_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_578" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
A comprehensive designation for divinities of all
kinds was "the heavenly family" (<i>te anau tuarangi</i>); and
this celestial race included rats, lizards, beetles, eels, sharks,
and several kinds of birds. It was supposed that "the
heavenly family" had taken up their abode in these creatures.<a name="FNanchor_33_579" id="FNanchor_33_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_579" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Nay, even inanimate objects, such as the triton-shell, sandstone,
bits of basalt, cinnet, and trees were believed to be
thus tenanted by gods.<a name="FNanchor_34_580" id="FNanchor_34_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_580" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The god Tane-kio, for example,
was thought to be enshrined in the planets Venus and Jupiter,
and also, curiously enough, in cinnet work.<a name="FNanchor_35_581" id="FNanchor_35_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_581" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Again, each tribe
had its own sacred bird, which was supposed to be sent by
a god to warn the people of impending danger.<a name="FNanchor_36_582" id="FNanchor_36_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_582" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In these
superstitions it is possible that we have relics of totemism.</p>

<p>Originally, it is said, the gods spoke to men through the
small land birds, but the utterances of these creatures proved
too indistinct to guide the actions of mankind. Hence to
meet this emergency an order of priests was set apart, the
gods actually taking up their abode, for the time being, in
their sacred persons. Hence priests were significantly named<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
"god-boxes" (<i>pia-atua</i>) a title which was generally abbreviated
to "gods," because they were believed to be living
embodiments of the divinities. When a priest was consulted,
he drank a bowl of kava (<i>Piper methysticum</i>), and falling into
convulsions gave the oracular response in language intelligible
only to the initiated. The oracle so delivered, from
which there was no appeal, was thought to have been inspired
by the god, who had entered into the priest for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_37_583" id="FNanchor_37_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_583" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 5. <i>The Doctrine of the Human Soul</i></h4>

<p>Like other Polynesians, the Hervey Islanders believed
that human beings are animated by a vital principle or soul,
which survives the death of the body for a longer or shorter
time. Indeed, they held that nobody dies a strictly natural
death except as an effect of extreme old age. Nineteen
out of twenty deaths were believed to be caused either
by the anger of the gods or by the incantations of "the
praying people" or sorcerers.<a name="FNanchor_38_584" id="FNanchor_38_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_584" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Hence, when a person
fell ill, it was customary to consult a priest in order to
discover the nature of the sin which had drawn down on
the sufferer the wrath of the deity or the enmity of the
sorcerer.<a name="FNanchor_39_585" id="FNanchor_39_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_585" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> But besides its final departure at death, the soul
was thought to quit the body temporarily on other occasions.
In sleep it was supposed to leave the sleeper and travel over
the island, holding converse with the dead, and even visiting
the spirit-world. It was thus that the islanders, like so
many other savages, explained the phenomena of dreams.
We are told that some of the most important events in their
national history were determined by dreams.<a name="FNanchor_40_586" id="FNanchor_40_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_586" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Again, they
explained sneezing as the return of the soul to the body after
a temporary absence. Hence in Rarotonga, when a person
sneezes, the bystanders exclaim, as though addressing his
spirit, "Ha! you have come back!"<a name="FNanchor_41_587" id="FNanchor_41_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_587" class="fnanchor">[41]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>How exactly the Hervey Islanders pictured to themselves
the nature of the human soul, appears not to be recorded.
Probably their notions on this obscure subject did not differ
greatly from those of the natives of Pukapuka or Danger
Island, a lonely island situated some hundreds of miles to
the north-west of the Hervey Group. These savages apparently
conceived the soul as a small material substance that
varied in size with the dimensions of the body which it
inhabited. For the sacred men or sorcerers of that island
used to set traps to catch the souls of people, and the traps
consisted of loops of coco-nut fibre, which differed in size
according as the soul to be caught in one of them was fat or
thin, or perhaps according as it was the soul of a child or
that of an adult. Two of these soul-traps were presented to
Mr. W. W. Gill, the first white missionary to land in Danger
Island. The loops or rings were arranged in pairs on each
side of two cords, one of which was twenty-eight feet long and
the other fourteen. The mode of setting the traps was this.
If a person was very sick or had given offence to a sorcerer,
the offended wizard or priest would hang a soul-trap by night
from a branch of a tree overhanging the house of the sufferer
or of the person against whom he bore a grudge; then sitting
down beside the snare he would pretend to watch for the
flight of the victim's spirit. If the family enquired the sin
for which the soul-trap had been set, the holy man would
probably allege some ceremonial fault committed by the sick
man against the gods. If an insect or small bird chanced
to fly through one of the loops, the priest would allege that
the man's soul was caught in the mesh, and that there was
no hope for it but that the wretch must die. In that case
the demon Vaerua, who presided over the spirit-world, was
believed to hurry off the poor soul to the nether world, there
to feast upon it. The news that So-and-so had lost his soul
would then spread through the island, and great would be
the lamentation. The friends of the unhappy man would
seek to propitiate the sorcerer by large presents of food,
begging him to intercede with the dread Vaerua for the
restoration of the lost soul. Sometimes the intercessions
were successful, and the patient recovered; but at other
times the priest reported that his prayers were of no avail,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
and that Vaerua could not be induced to send back the soul
to re-inhabit the body. The melancholy tidings acted like a
sentence of death. The patient gave up all hope and soon
pined away through sheer distress at the thought of his soul
caught in the trap.<a name="FNanchor_42_588" id="FNanchor_42_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_588" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 6. <i>Death and Funeral Rites</i></h4>

<p>The moment a sick person expired, his near relatives cut
off their hair, blackened their faces, and slashed their bodies
with shark's teeth, so that the blood might stream down;
in Rarotonga it was customary also to knock out some of
the front teeth in token of sorrow. During the days of
mourning people wore only native cloth, dyed red in the sap
of the candle-nut tree and then dipped in the black mud of
a taro-patch. The very foul smell of these garments is said
to have been symbolical of the putrescent state of the corpse;<a name="FNanchor_43_589" id="FNanchor_43_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_589" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
perhaps at the same time, though we are not told so, it
helped to keep the ghost at arm's length.</p>

<p>That the mourners were not anxious to detain the
departed spirit appears from a custom observed by the Rarotongans
and described by the discoverer of the island, John
Williams. He tells us that in order to secure the admission
of a departed spirit to future joys, the corpse was dressed
in the best attire the relatives could provide, the head was
wreathed with flowers, and other decorations were added. A
pig was then baked whole and placed on the body of the
deceased, surrounded by a pile of vegetable food. After
that, supposing the departed to have been a son, the father
would thus address the corpse: "My son, when you were
alive I treated you with kindness, and when you were taken
ill I did my best to restore you to health; and now you are
dead, there is your <i>momoe o</i>, or property of admission. Go,
my son, and with that gain an entrance into the palace of
Tiki,<a name="FNanchor_44_590" id="FNanchor_44_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_590" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and do not come to this world again to disturb and
alarm us." The whole would then be buried; and, if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
received no intimation to the contrary within a few days of the
interment, the relatives believed that the pig and the rest of
the victuals had obtained for the deceased an entrance to the
abode of bliss. If, however, a cricket was heard to chirp in
the house, it was deemed an ill omen, and they would immediately
break into loud laments, saying, for example, "Oh, our
brother! his spirit has not entered the paradise; he is
suffering from hunger; he is shivering with cold!" Forthwith
the grave would be opened and the offering repeated.
This usually effected the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_45_591" id="FNanchor_45_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_591" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In Rarotonga the provisions which were buried with the
dead person as an offering to Tiki sometimes consisted of
the head and kidneys of a hog, a split coco-nut, and a root
of kava; in the island of Aitutaki it was usual to place at
the pit of the stomach of the corpse the kernel of a coco-nut,
and a piece of sugar-cane; in Mangaia the extremity of a
coco-nut frond served the same purpose of propitiating Tiki
and ensuring the entrance of the ghost into paradise.<a name="FNanchor_46_592" id="FNanchor_46_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_592" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The bodies of the dead were anointed with scented oil,
carefully wrapt up in a number of cloths, and so committed
to their last resting-place. They were never disembowelled
for the purpose of embalming, but some were desiccated by
being kept for about a month and daily anointed with coco-nut
oil. A few were buried in the earth within the precincts
of a sacred grove (<i>marae</i>); but by far the greater number
were hidden in caves which were regarded as the private
property of certain families. The bodies of warriors were
in general carefully concealed by their friends, lest foes should
find and burn them in revenge. If a body were buried in
the earth, it was always laid face downwards, with chin and
knees meeting, and the limbs well secured with coco-nut
fibre. A thin covering of earth was spread over the corpse,
and large heavy stones were piled on the grave. "The
intention," we are informed, "was to render it impossible for
the dead to rise up and injure the living." The head of the
corpse was always turned to the rising sun. It was customary
to bury with the dead some article of value: a woman would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
have her cloth-mallet laid by her side, while a man would
enjoin his friends to bury with him a favourite stone adze or a
beautiful white shell (<i>Ovula ovum</i>, Linn.) which he had worn
in the dance. Such articles were never afterwards touched
by the living. Many people were buried in easily accessible
caves, that their relatives might visit the mouldering remains
from time to time. On such visits the corpse might be again
exposed to the sun, anointed afresh with oil, and wrapt in
new cloth. But as the sorrow of the survivors abated, these
visits became less and less frequent, and finally ceased.<a name="FNanchor_47_593" id="FNanchor_47_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_593" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>A death in a family was the signal for a change of names
among the near relatives of the deceased. The greatest
ingenuity was exercised in devising new appellations. Sometimes
these names were most offensive to good taste. This
custom of changing names after the death of a relative has
survived the conversion of the natives to Christianity;<a name="FNanchor_48_594" id="FNanchor_48_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_594" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
probably it originated in a desire to avoid the unwelcome
attentions of the ghost, who might be thought to be attracted
by the sound of the familiar names.<a name="FNanchor_49_595" id="FNanchor_49_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_595" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the corpse was committed to its last resting-place,
the mourners selected five old coco-nuts, opened them
one after the other, and poured the water on the ground.
These nuts were then wrapt up in leaves and native cloth
and thrown towards the grave; or, if the corpse had been
let down by cords into the deep chasm called Auraka, the
nuts and other food would be cast down successively upon
it. Calling loudly each time the name of the departed, they
said, "Here is thy food; eat it." When the fifth nut and
the accompanying pudding were thrown down, the mourners
cried, "Farewell! we come back no more to thee."<a name="FNanchor_50_596" id="FNanchor_50_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_596" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after a decease a remarkable custom was
observed in Mangaia. A messenger was despatched to bear
the tidings round the island. On reaching the boundary of
each district, he paused to give the war-shout peculiar to
the people of the district, adding, "So-and-so is dead."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Thereupon near relatives would start off at once for the
house of the deceased, each carrying a present of native
cloth. Most of the athletic young men of the entire island
on the day following united in a series of sham-fights called
<i>ta i te mauri</i> or "slaying the ghosts." The district where
the corpse lay represented the <i>mauri</i> or ghosts. The young
men belonging to it early in the morning arrayed themselves
as if for battle, and, well armed, started off for the adjoining
district, where the young men were drawn up in battle array
under the name of <i>aka-oa</i> or "friends." Having performed
the war-dance, the two parties rushed together, clashing
their spears and wooden swords, as though fighting in good
earnest. The sufferers in this bloodless conflict were supposed
to be malignant spirits, who would thus be deterred
from doing further mischief to mortals. After the mock
battle the combatants united, and, being collectively called
<i>mauri</i> or "ghosts," passed on to the third district. Throughout
the day their leader carried the sacred <i>iku kikau</i>, or
coco-nut leaf, at the pit of his stomach, like a dead man.
Arrived at the third village, they found the younger men
ready for the friendly conflict and bearing the name of
<i>aka-oa</i> or "friends." The battle of the ghosts was fought
over again, and then with swelling numbers they passed on
to the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, in every one of them
fighting and thrashing the ghosts afresh. Repairing at last
with united forces to the place where the corpse was laid
out in state, the brave ghost-killers were there entertained
at a feast, after which all, except the near relatives, returned
to their various homes at nightfall. So similar to actual
warfare was this custom of fighting the ghosts that it went
by the name of "a younger brother of war."<a name="FNanchor_51_597" id="FNanchor_51_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_597" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Apparently
every death was attributed to the action of ghosts who had
carried off the soul of the departed brother or sister; and
in order to prevent a repetition of the catastrophe it was
deemed necessary to repel or even to slay the ghostly
assailants by force of arms.</p>

<p>The mourning ceremonies lasted from ten to fifteen days
according to the rank and age of the deceased. During the
whole period no beating of bark for the manufacture of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
native cloth was permitted in the district where the death
had occurred. A woman who wished to beat out her bark-cloth
must go to another part of the island. This rule is
said to have been dictated by a fear of offending the female
demon Mueu, who introduced the beating of bark-cloth into
the world, but who herself beats out cloth of a very different
texture; for her cloth-flail is the stroke of death.<a name="FNanchor_52_598" id="FNanchor_52_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_598" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Some months after the decease of a person of note
funeral games called <i>eva</i> were performed in honour of the
departed. These ceremonies invariably took place by day.
They were of four sorts.</p>

<p>First, there was the <i>eva tapara</i>, or "funeral dirge." In
this the mourners appeared with blackened faces, shaved
heads, streaming blood, and stinking garments. This, we
are told, was a most repulsive exhibition.<a name="FNanchor_53_599" id="FNanchor_53_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_599" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Second, there was the <i>eva puruki</i> or "war dirge." In
this the people arrayed themselves in two columns facing
each other, both sides armed with spears made of a brittle
kind of wood instead of the fatal iron-wood (<i>Casuarina
equasitifolia</i>), out of which the spears used in real warfare
were made. The performance began with an animated
conversation between the leaders of the two squadrons of
supposed enemies as to the grounds for war. When this
was concluded, the person most nearly related to the
deceased began the history of the heroic deeds of the clan
by slowly chanting the introductory words. At the appointed
pause both companies took up the strain and chanted it
vigorously together, the mighty chorus being accompanied
by the clash of spears and all the evolutions of war. Then
followed a momentary pause, after which a new story would
be introduced by the musical voice of the chief mourner, to
be caught up and recited in full chorus by both companies
as before. These war-dirges were most carefully elaborated,
and they embodied the only histories of the past known to
these islanders.<a name="FNanchor_54_600" id="FNanchor_54_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_600" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Third, there was the <i>eva toki</i> or "axe dirge." In this
ceremony the performers, armed with mimic axes of iron-wood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
instead of stone, used to cleave the cruel earth which
had swallowed up the dead; and as they smote the ground,
with tears streaming down their cheeks, they expressed a
vain wish that so they might open up a passage through
which the spirit of the departed might return. This axe-dirge
was appropriate to artisans only, who enjoyed great
consideration because their skill was believed to be a gift
of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_55_601" id="FNanchor_55_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_601" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Fourth, there was the <i>eva ta</i> or "crashing dirge." In
this ceremony two supposed armies were arrayed against
each other as in the "war dirge," but differed from it both in
the style of composition and in the weapons employed, the
combatants being armed with flat spears or wooden swords.
In the dialogue or songs the death of their friends was
explained by the anger of the gods, for which reasons were
assigned. These performances generally concluded with a
sort of comedy, the nature of which has not been described.<a name="FNanchor_56_602" id="FNanchor_56_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_602" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes, instead of these funeral games or ceremonies,
a grand tribal gathering was held for the sake of reciting
songs in honour of the illustrious dead. Such an assembly
met in a large house built for the purpose and well lighted
with torches, for the doleful concert always took place at
night. As many as sixty songs might be prepared for
the occasion and mournfully chanted to the accompanying
drone of the great wooden drum. Every adult male
relative was bound to recite a song; if he could not compose
one himself, he had to pay a more gifted person to furnish
him with the appropriate words. Some of the songs or
ballads of a touching nature were much admired and long
remembered. Several months were needed for the preparation
of such a performance or "death-talk," as it was called.
Not only had the songs to be composed and the dresses
made, but a liberal supply of food had to be provided for the
guests.<a name="FNanchor_57_603" id="FNanchor_57_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_603" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>In general all mourning ceremonies were over within a
year of the death. But we hear of a chief of the island of
Atiu who mourned for seven years for an only child, living<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
all that time in a hut near the grave, and allowing his hair
and nails to grow, and his body to remain unwashed. He
was the wonder of all the islanders.<a name="FNanchor_58_604" id="FNanchor_58_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_604" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Among the caverns in which, in the island of Mangaia,
the dead used to be deposited, two are particularly famous.
One of them, at Tamarua, is the chasm called Raupa or
"leafy entrance" on account of the dense growth of hibiscus
which formerly surrounded this supposed entrance to the
shades. It was the ancient burial-place of the Tongan
tribe, the descendants of a band of Tongans, who had landed
in Mangaia and settled there. The chasm is a hundred and
fifty feet deep and has two openings, the smaller of which
was used only for chiefs and priests. The other famous
sepulchral cavern, called Auraka, is situated on the western
side of the island. It was the grand depository of the dead
of the ruling families, who claimed to be descended from the
great god Rongo. This chasm is not nearly so deep as
Raupa, but, like it, has two entrances; the one sacred and
the other profane; the former was reserved for the bodies of
the nobility, the latter for the bodies of commoners. Besides
these ceremonial entrances there are many natural openings
into the vast subterranean cave, for the rock is everywhere
perforated. It is possible by torchlight to explore the
gloomy recesses of the cavern, which in some places contracts
to the narrowest dimensions, while in others it expands
till the roof is almost lost to sight. Hundreds of well-preserved
mummies may be seen lying in rows, some on
ledges of stalactite, others on wooden platforms. Mr. Gill,
who thrice visited the cave, judged that some of the bodies
were over fifty years old. The whole neighbourhood of the
great cavern was deemed sacred to wandering disembodied
spirits, who were believed to come up at midnight and exhibit
the ghastly wounds by which they had met their fate.<a name="FNanchor_59_605" id="FNanchor_59_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_605" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<h4>&sect; 7. <i>The Fate of the Human Soul after Death</i></h4>

<p>The home of the departed spirits was believed to be a
vast subterranean region called Avaiki. The natives of
Mangaia believed that this mysterious region was situated
directly under their island. "As the dead were usually
thrown down the deepest chasms, it was not unnatural for
their friends to imagine the earth to be hollow, and the
entrance to this vast nether world to be down one of these
pits. No one can wonder at this who knows that the outer
portion of Mangaia is a honeycomb, the rock being pierced
in every direction with winding caves and frightful chasms.
It is asserted that the Mission premises at Oneroa are built
over one of these great caverns, which extends so far towards
the sea that the beating of the surf can be distinctly heard,
whilst the water, purified from its saline particles, continually
drips from the stony roof." The inland opening into the
infernal regions was believed to be the great cavern of
Auraka, in which, as we have just seen, so many of the
dead were deposited.<a name="FNanchor_60_606" id="FNanchor_60_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_606" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>However, Avaiki was not the home of the ghosts alone;
it was tenanted also by the gods, both the greater and the
lesser, with their dependants. There they married, and
multiplied, and quarrelled, just like mortals. There they
planted, cooked, fished, and inhabited dwellings of exactly
the same sort as exist on earth. Their food was no better
than that of mortals. There might be seen birds, fish, and
rats, likewise the mantis, centipedes, and beetles. There the
coco-nut palm, the pandanus, and the myrtle flourished, and
yams grew in abundance. The gods committed murder and
adultery; they got drunk; they lied; they stole. The arts
and crafts were also practised by the deities, who indeed
taught them to mankind. The visible world, in short, was
but a gross copy of the spiritual and invisible world. If fire
burns, it is because latent flame was hidden in wood by the
god Mauike in Hades. If the axe cleaves, it is because the
fairy of the axe is present unseen in the blade. If the ironwood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
club kills its man, it is because a fierce demon from
Tonga lives in the weapon.<a name="FNanchor_61_607" id="FNanchor_61_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_607" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The old high-road to the spirit-land used to start from a
place called Aremauku, on a cliff overhanging the western
ocean. By this road a regular communication was formerly
kept up with the infernal regions. It was by this route, for
example, that the hero Maui descended in ancient days to
the home of the fire-god Mauike and brought up fire for the
use of men. However, the denizens of spirit-land in time
grew very troublesome by constantly coming up and afflicting
mankind with disease and death; they also created a dearth
by stealing people's food, and they even ravished their wives.
To put an end to these perpetual annoyances a brave and
beautiful woman, Tiki by name, rolled herself alive down into
the gloomy chasm which led to the infernal world. The
yawning abyss closed on her, and there has been no thoroughfare
ever since. The spirits have not been able to come up
from Avaiki by that road, and the souls of the dead have
been equally unable to go down by it; they are now obliged
to descend by a different route.<a name="FNanchor_62_608" id="FNanchor_62_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_608" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>After their departure from the body the spirits of the
dead wandered disconsolately along the seashore, picking
their steps painfully among the sharp spikes of the coral and
stumbling over the bindweed and thick vines which caught
their feet. The fragrant smell of the heliotrope, which grows
luxuriantly among these barren and rugged rocks, afforded
them a little relief, and they wore a red creeper, like a
turban, round their heads; the rest of their costume was a
miscellaneous collection of weeds which they had picked up
in the course of their wanderings. Twice a year, at the
summer and winter solstices, they mustered to follow the
setting sun down into the under world. They gathered at
the two points of the island which face towards the rising of
the sun at these two seasons of the year. At the summer
solstice, in January, he seems to rise out of the sea opposite
to Ana-Kura, that is, the Red Cave, so called because it
receives the red rays of the morning. It was there that by
far the greater number of the ghosts gathered for their last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
sad journey with the sun: they all belonged to the southern
half of the island. The other point of ghostly muster was
called Karanga-iti or "the Little Welcome"; it faced towards
the rising of the sun at the winter solstice in June, and it
was there that the ghosts born in the northern half of the
island assembled. Thus many months might elapse between
a death and the final departure of the soul from the land of
the living. The weary interval was spent by the spirits in
dancing and revisiting their old homes. As a rule they were
well disposed to their living relatives, but the ghost of a mother
would often grow vindictive when she saw her pet child ill-treated
by its stepmother. Sometimes, weary of wandering,
the poor ghosts huddled together in the Red Cave, waiting
for the midsummer sun and listening to the monotonous
moan of the great rollers, which break there eternally.<a name="FNanchor_63_609" id="FNanchor_63_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_609" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The exact moment of departure was fixed by the leader
of the band. As the time drew near, messengers were despatched
to call in the stray ghosts who might be lingering
near their ancient haunts. Tearfully they gathered at the
Red Cave or on a grassy lawn above it, out of reach of the
foam and the billows. All kept their eyes on the spot of
the horizon where the sun was expected to appear. At the
first streak of dawn the whole band took their departure to
meet the rising orb of day. That done, they followed in his
train as nearly as might be, flitting behind or beneath him
across the rolling waters or the rocks and stones of the coast,
till towards the close of day they all mustered at Vairo-rongo,
"the Sacred Stream of Rongo," facing towards the
setting sun. The spot is so named from a little rivulet
which there rushes out of the stones at the sacred grove
(<i>marae</i>) of Rongo: none but priests and kings might bathe
there in days of old. At the moment when the sun sank
beneath the horizon, the entire band of ghosts followed him
along the golden track of light across the shimmering sea and
descended in his train to the nether world, but not like him
to reappear on the morrow.<a name="FNanchor_64_610" id="FNanchor_64_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_610" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>There were three such points of departure for the spirit-land
in Mangaia, all facing the setting sun. Each of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
was known as a <i>Reinga vaerua</i> or "leaping-place of souls."
One of them was at Oneroa, where a rocky bluff stands out
by itself like a giant looking towards the west. To it a band
of souls from the great cavern of Auraka used to go in
mournful procession, and from it they leaped one by one
to a second and much smaller block of stone resting on the
inner edge of the reef; thence they passed to the outer brink
of the reef, on which the surf beats ceaselessly, and from
which at sunset they flitted over the ocean to sink with the
great luminary into the land of the dead.</p>

<p>Such appears to have been the general notion of the
people concerning the departure of human souls at death in
Mangaia. Similar ideas prevailed in the other islands of the
group, in all of which the "leaping-place of souls" was regularly
situated on the western coast of the island.<a name="FNanchor_65_611" id="FNanchor_65_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_611" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The teaching of the priests added many particulars to this
general account of the journey of the soul to the nether world.
According to them the souls of the dying, before life was
quite extinct, left their bodies and travelled towards the edge
of the cliff at Araia, near the sacred grove (<i>marae</i>) of Rongo,
which faced westward. But if on its way to this fatal bourne
the soul of the dying chanced to meet a friendly spirit who
cried to it, "Go back and live," the departing soul would joyfully
return to its forsaken body, and the sick man or woman
would revive. This was the native explanation of fainting.
But if no friendly spirit intervened to save the passing
soul, it pursued its way to the edge of the cliff. On its
arrival a great wave of the sea washed the base of the crag,
and a gigantic <i>bua</i> tree (<i>Beslaria laurifolia</i>), covered with
fragrant blossoms, sprang up from Avaiki to receive the
ghost. The tree had as many branches as there were
principal gods in Mangaia, and every ghost had to perch
on the particular branch allotted to members of his or her
tribe; the worshippers of the great gods, such as Motoro
and Tane, had separate boughs provided for their accommodation;
while the worshippers of the lesser deities
huddled together on a single big branch.<a name="FNanchor_66_612" id="FNanchor_66_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_612" class="fnanchor">[66]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had the ghost perched on the place appointed
for him than down plumped the tree with him into the nether
world. Looking down to see where he was going, what was
the horror of the ghost to perceive a great net spread by
Akaanga and his assistants to catch him at the foot of the
tree! Into this fatal net the doomed spirit inevitably fell to
sink in a lake of fresh water and there to wriggle like a fish
for a time. At last the net was pulled up with the ghost in it,
who, half-drowned, was now ushered trembling into the presence
of the grim hag Miru, generally known as "the Ruddy,"
because her face reflected the glowing heat of the ever-burning
oven in which she cooked her ghostly victims. At first,
however, she fed, and perhaps fattened, them on a diet of
black beetles, red earth-worms, crabs, and small blackbirds.
Thus refreshed, they had next to drain bowls of strong kava
brewed by the fair hands of the hag's four lovely daughters.
Reduced to a state of insensibility by the intoxicating beverage,
the ghosts were then borne off without a struggle to the
oven and cooked. On the substance of these hapless victims
Miru and her son and her peerless daughters regularly
subsisted. The leavings of the meal were thrown to the
servants. Such was the fate of all who died what we should
call a natural death, and therefore of all cowards, women,
and children. They were annihilated.<a name="FNanchor_67_613" id="FNanchor_67_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_613" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Not so with warriors who fell fighting on the field of
battle. For a time, indeed, their souls wandered about
among the rocks and trees where their bodies were thrown,
the ghastly wounds by which they met their fate being still
visible. The plaintive chirping of a certain cricket, rarely
seen but heard continually at night, was believed to be the
voice of the slain warriors sorrowfully calling to their friends.
At last the first who fell would gather his brother ghosts at
a place a little beyond Araia, on the edge of the cliff and
facing the sunset. There they would linger for a time.
But suddenly a mountain sprang up at their feet, and they
ascended it over the spears and clubs which had given them
their mortal wounds. Arrived at the summit they leaped up
into the blue expanse, thus becoming the peculiar clouds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the winter or dry season. During the rainy season they
could mount up to the warriors' paradise in the sky. In
June, the first month of winter, the atmosphere was pervaded
by these ghosts, to whom the chilliness of death still
clung. For days together their thronging shapes hid the
sun, dimming the sky and spreading among men the
heaviness and oppression of spirits which are characteristic
of the season. But with the early days of August, when
the coral-tree puts forth its blood-red blossoms and the sky
grows mottled with light fleecy clouds, the ghosts of the
brave prepare to take flight for heaven. Soon the sky is
cloudless, the weather bright and warm. The ghosts have
fled away, and the living resume their wonted avocations in
quiet and comfort.<a name="FNanchor_68_614" id="FNanchor_68_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_614" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In their celestial home the spirits of the slain are
immortal. There, in memory of their deeds on earth, they
dance their old war dances over again, decked with gay
flowers&mdash;the white gardenia, the yellow <i>bua</i>, the golden fruit
of the pandanus, and the dark crimson, bell-like blossom of
the native laurel, intertwined with myrtle; and from their
blissful heights they look down with pity and disgust on the
wretched souls in Avaiki entangled in the fatal net and
besmeared with filth. For the spirits of the slain in battle are
strong and vigorous, their bodies never having been wasted
by disease; whereas the spirits of those who die a natural
death are excessively feeble and weak, like their bodies at
the moment of dissolution. The natural result of such
beliefs was to breed an utter contempt for a violent death,
nay even a desire to seek it. Many stories are told of aged
warriors, scarcely able to hold a spear, who have insisted on
being led to the battlefield in the hope of finding a soldier's
death and gaining a soldier's paradise.<a name="FNanchor_69_615" id="FNanchor_69_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_615" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Beliefs of the same general character concerning the fate
of the dead prevailed in other islands of the Hervey Group.
Thus in Rarotonga the great meeting-place of the ghosts
was at Tuoro, facing the sunset. There at a stately tree,
called "the Weeping Laurel," the disembodied spirits used
to bewail their hard fate. If no pitying spirit sent him back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
to life, the ghost had to scramble up a branch of an ancient
<i>bua</i> tree which grew on the spot. Should the bough
break under his weight, the ghost was precipitated into
the net which Muru had spread out for him in a natural
circular hollow of the rock. A lively ghost might break
the meshes of the net and escape for a while, but passing
on to the outer edge of the reef, in the hope of traversing
the ocean, he inevitably fell into another net artfully concealed
by Akaanga. From this second net escape was
impossible. The demons drew the captive ghosts out of
the nets, and ruthlessly dashing out their brains on the
sharp coral they carried off the shattered victims in triumph
to devour them in the lower world. Ghosts from Ngatangiia
ascended the noble mountain range which stretches across the
island, dipping into the sea at Tuoro. Inexpressibly weary
and sad was this journey over a road which foot of living wight
had never trod. The departed spirits of this tribe met at a
great iron-wood tree, of which some branches were green and
others dead. The souls that trod on the green branches came
back to life; but the souls that crawled on to the dead
boughs were at once caught in the net either of Muru or
of Akaanga.<a name="FNanchor_70_616" id="FNanchor_70_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_616" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>In Rarotonga, as in Mangaia, the lot of warriors who died
in battle was much happier than that of the poor wretches who
had the misfortune to die quietly in bed or to be otherwise ignominiously
snuffed out. The gallant ghosts were said to join
Tiki, who in Rarotonga appears to have been a dead warrior,
whereas in Mangaia, as we saw, Tiki was a dead woman.
In the Rarotongan Hades, which also went by the name of
Avaiki, this Tiki sat at the threshold of a very long house
built with walls of reeds, and surrounded by shrubs and flowers
of fadeless bloom and never-failing perfume. Each ghost on
his arrival had to make an offering to the warder Tiki, who,
thus propitiated, admitted him to the house. There, sitting
at their ease, eating, drinking, dancing, or sleeping, the brave
of past ages dwelt in unwithering beauty and perpetual
youth; there they welcomed newcomers, and there they
told the story of their heroic exploits on earth and fought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
their old battles over again. But ghosts who had nothing
to give to Tiki were compelled to stay outside in rain and
darkness for ever, shivering with cold and hunger, watching
with envious eyes the joyous revels of the inmates, and
racked with the vain desire of being admitted to share them.<a name="FNanchor_71_617" id="FNanchor_71_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_617" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Such beliefs in the survival of the soul after death may
have nerved the warrior with fresh courage in battle; but
they can have contributed but little to the happiness and
consolation of ordinary people, who could apparently look
forward to nothing better in the life hereafter than being
cooked and eaten by a hideous hag.</p>

the people darker than in Rarotonga,
undersized, sturdy, with thick lips,
noses broad and sunken at the bridge,
which gave them a somewhat wild
appearance. As to the tradition of an
emigration of the Hervey Islanders
from Samoa, see W. W. Gill, <i>Life in
the Southern Isles</i>, pp. 23 <i>sqq.</i> "The
Mangaians themselves trace their origin
to Avaiki, or nether world; but Avaiki,
Hawai'i, and Savai'i, are but slightly
different forms of one word. The <i>s</i>
of the Samoan dialect is invariably
dropped in the Hervey Group dialects,
whilst a <i>k</i> is substituted for the break
at the end. No native of these days
doubts that by Avaiki his ancestors
really intended Savai'i, the largest
island of the Samoan Group. In
Polynesia, to sail <i>west</i> is to go <i>down</i>;
to sail <i>east</i> is to go <i>up</i>. To sail from
Samoa to Mangaia would be 'to come
up,' or, to translate their vernacular
closely, 'to climb up.' In their songs
and myths are many references to 'the
hosts of <i>Uk</i>upolu,' undoubtedly the
Upolu of Samoa" (W. W. Gill, <i>op. cit.</i>

"These <i>maraes</i> were planted with

<h3>THE BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY AMONG THE SOCIETY ISLANDERS</h3>


<h4>&sect; 1. <i>The Society Islands</i></h4>

<p>The Society Islands are a large and scattered archipelago
in the South Pacific, situated within 16&deg; and 18&deg; of South
latitude, and between 148&deg; and 155&deg; of West longitude. They
lie some three hundred miles from the Hervey or Cook
Islands, from which they are separated by the open sea. The
islands form a chain nearly two hundred miles in length,
extending from north-west to south-east, and fall into two
groups, an eastern and a western, which, on account of the
prevailing wind, are known respectively as the Windward
and Leeward Islands. The Windward or eastern group
includes Eimeo or Mo&ouml;rea in the west, Maitea in the east,
and Tahiti, the principal island of the whole archipelago, in
the centre. In the Leeward or western group the chief
islands are Huahine, Raiatea, Tahaa, and Borabora. The
islands appear to have been first discovered by the Spanish
navigator Fernandez de Quiros in 1606 or 1607, but after
him they were lost sight of till 1767, when they were rediscovered
by Wallis. A few years later they were repeatedly
visited by Captain Cook, who gave the first full and accurate
description of the islands and their inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_1_618" id="FNanchor_1_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_618" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The islands, with the exception of a few flat lagoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
islands, are of volcanic formation, high and mountainous,
consisting for the most part of a central peak or peaks of
bold and striking outline, which descend in steep ridges
towards the sea, sometimes reaching the coast, but oftener
leaving a broad stretch of flat and very fertile land between
their last slopes and the beach. Between the ridges lie deep
and beautiful valleys, watered by winding streams and teeming
with luxuriant vegetation. The rocks of which the islands
consist are all igneous, chiefly trachyte, dolerite, basalt, and
lava. They are considered by geologists to present perhaps
the most wonderful and instructive example of volcanic rocks
to be seen on the globe. Yet, though the islands are judged
to be of comparatively recent formation, there are no traces of
volcanic action in them at the present time. The craters
have disappeared: hot springs do not exist; and earthquakes
are rare.<a name="FNanchor_2_619" id="FNanchor_2_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_619" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Society Islands, and Tahiti in particular, are famous
for the beauty of their natural scenery; indeed, by general
consent they appear to rank as the fairest islands in the
Pacific. Travellers vie with each other in praise of their
enchanting loveliness. Tahiti, the largest island of the
group, may be taken as typical of them all. It consists of
two almost circular islands united by a very low and
narrow neck of land: the northern and larger island is known
as Tahiti the Great (Tahiti nui), the southern and smaller
island is known as Tahiti the Little (Tahiti iti). In the
centre of each island the mountains rise in craggy peaks,
sometimes in the shape of pyramids or sugar-loaves, their
rocky sides clothed with every variety of verdure, and
enlivened here and there by cataracts falling from lofty cliffs,
while the shore is washed by the white-crested waves of the
Pacific breaking in foam on the coral reefs or dashing in
spray on the beach. The scene is especially striking when
beheld for the first time from the sea at sunrise on a fine
morning. Then the happy combination of land and water,
of precipices and plains, of umbrageous trees drooping their
pendent boughs over the sea, and distant mountains shown
in sublime outline and richest hues, all blended in the harmony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
of nature, produces in the beholder sensations of admiration
and delight. The inland scenery is of a different character,
but not less impressive. There the prospect is occasionally
extensive, but more frequently circumscribed. There is,
however, a startling boldness in the towering piles of basalt,
often heaped in picturesque confusion near the source or
margin of some crystal stream that flows in silence at their
base, or plashes purling over the rocks that obstruct its bed;
and there is the wildness of romance about the deep and
lonely glens, from which the mountains rise like the steep
sides of a natural amphitheatre till they seem to support the
clouds that rest upon their summits. In the character of the
teeming vegetation, too, from the verdant moss that drapes
the rocks to the rich foliage of the bread-fruit tree, the luxuriance
of the pandanus, and the waving plumes of the coconut
palm, all nurtured by a prolific soil and matured by the
genial heat of a tropical climate, there is enough to arrest
the attention and to strike the imagination of the wanderer,
who, in the unbroken silence that reigns in these pleasing
solitudes, may easily fancy himself astray in fairyland and
treading enchanted ground.<a name="FNanchor_3_620" id="FNanchor_3_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_620" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 2. <i>The Islanders and their Mode of Life</i></h4>

<p>The islanders are, or were at the date of their discovery
by Europeans, fine specimens of the Polynesian race, being
tall, well-proportioned, and robust. Captain Cook described
them as of the largest size of Europeans. Their complexion
varies from olive to bronze and reddish-brown, frequently
presenting a hue intermediate between the yellow of the
Malay and the copper-colour of the American Indians. The
hair is shining black or dark brown, usually straight, but
often soft and curly; never lank and wiry like that of the
American Indians, and only in rare cases woolly or frizzly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
like that of the Papuans. The men have beards, which they
used to wear in a variety of fashions, always, however, plucking
out the greater part. The shape of the face is comely,
and the facial angle is often as perpendicular as in Europeans.
The cheek-bones are not high; the nose is either straight or
aquiline, often accompanied by a fulness about the nostrils;
it is seldom flat, though it was formerly the practice of
mothers and nurses to press the nostrils of the female children,
a broad flat nose being by many regarded as a beauty.
The mouth in general is well formed, though the lips are
sometimes large and protuberant, yet never so much as to
resemble the lips of negroes; the chin is usually prominent.
The general aspect of the face very seldom presents any
likeness to the Tartar or Mongolian cast of countenance;
while the profile frequently bears a most striking resemblance
to that of Europeans. A roundness and fulness of figure,
not usually extending to corpulency, is characteristic of the
race, especially of the women. In general physique they
resemble the Sandwich Islanders and Tonga Islanders; according
to Ellis, they are more robust than the Marquesans,
but inferior in size and strength to the Maoris.<a name="FNanchor_4_621" id="FNanchor_4_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_621" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Their diet is chiefly vegetable; when Captain Cook
visited the islands, the only tame animals were hogs, dogs,
and poultry. Bread-fruit, taro, yams, bananas, and coconuts
are their staple food; the bread-fruit in particular has
been called their staff of life. Taro and yams are carefully
cultivated by the natives, and they also grow the sweet potato
as an article of food, though to a less extent than the other
two roots; in quality the sweet potato of Tahiti is far inferior
to that of the Sandwich Islands. The sea affords a great
variety of fish and shell-fish, which the natives catch and eat;
nothing that the sea produces is said to come amiss to them.
Hogs and dogs were in olden times the only quadrupeds
whose flesh was eaten by the Tahitians; but for the most
part they rarely tasted meat, subsisting almost exclusively
on a diet of fruit, vegetables, and fish.<a name="FNanchor_5_622" id="FNanchor_5_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_622" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>The common houses were of an oblong shape, usually
from eighteen to twenty-four feet in length, by eleven feet in
width, the long sides being parallel to each other, but the two
ends commonly rounded, especially in the houses of chiefs.
The thatched roofs were supported on three parallel rows of
wooden posts, and there being no outer walls and no partitions,
the wind blew freely through them. The floor was
covered with mats, forming a single cushion, on which the
people sat by day and slept at night. In some houses there
was a single stool appropriated to the use of the master of
the family; otherwise an ordinary dwelling contained little
or no furniture except a few small blocks of wood, hollowed
out on the upper surface so as to form head-rests or pillows.
The houses served chiefly as dormitories and as shelters in
rain: the people took their meals in the open air. Chiefs,
however, often owned houses of much larger dimensions,
which were built and maintained for them at the common
expense of the district. Some of these chiefly dwellings
were two hundred feet long, thirty feet broad, and twenty
feet high under the ridge; one of them, belonging to the
king, measured three hundred and seventy feet in length.
We read of houses which could contain two or three thousand
people;<a name="FNanchor_6_623" id="FNanchor_6_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_623" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and of one particular house in Tahiti we are
informed that it was no less than three hundred and ninety-seven
feet long by forty-eight feet broad, and that the roof
was supported in the middle by twenty wooden pillars, each
twenty-one feet high, while the sides or eaves of the roof
rested on one hundred and twenty-four pillars, each ten feet
high. A wooden wall or fence enclosed the whole. This
great house was used for the celebration of feasts, which
sometimes lasted for days together, and at which nearly all
the hogs in the island were consumed.<a name="FNanchor_7_624" id="FNanchor_7_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_624" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Like all the Polynesians down to the date of their discovery
by Europeans, the inhabitants of the Society Islands
were totally ignorant of the use and even of the existence of
the metals, and they had to employ substitutes, chiefly stone
and bone, for the manufacture of their tools and weapons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Of their tools Captain Cook gives the following account:
"They have an adze of stone; a chisel, or gouge, of bone,
generally that of a man's arm between the wrist and elbow;
a rasp of coral; and the skin of a sting-ray, with coral sand,
as a filer or polisher. This is a complete catalogue of their
tools, and with these they build houses, construct canoes,
hew stone, and fell, cleave, carve, and polish timber. The
stone which makes the blade of their adzes is a kind of
basaltes, of a blackish or grey colour, not very hard, but of
considerable toughness: they are of different sizes; some,
that are intended for felling, weigh from six to eight pounds;
others, that are used for carving, not more than so many
ounces; but it is necessary to sharpen both almost every
minute; for which purpose, a stone and a cocoa-nut shell
full of water are always at hand. Their greatest exploit,
to which these tools are less equal than to any other, is
felling a tree; this requires many hands, and the constant
labour of several days."<a name="FNanchor_8_625" id="FNanchor_8_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_625" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The earliest missionaries expressed
their astonishment that with such simple tools
the natives could carve so neatly and finish so smoothly;
our most ingenious workmen, they declared, could not
excel them.<a name="FNanchor_9_626" id="FNanchor_9_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_626" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The principal manufacture of the Society Islanders was
the making of the cloth which they used for their garments.
The material for the cloth was furnished by the bark of
several trees, including the paper-mulberry, the bread-fruit
tree, and a species of wild fig-tree. Having been stripped
from the tree and soaked in water, the bark was spread out
on a beam and beaten with heavy wooden mallets, till it was
reduced to the proper degree of thinness and flexibility.
The finest and most valuable kind of cloth was made chiefly,
and sometimes entirely, from the bark of the paper-mulberry
and was bleached pure white. But vegetable dyes were also
commonly employed to stain the cloth with a variety of hues
arranged in patterns. The favourite colours were a brilliant
scarlet and a bright yellow; Captain Cook described the
scarlet as exceedingly beautiful, brighter and more delicate
than any we have in Europe; it was produced by a mixture
of the juices of two vegetables, the fruit of a species of fig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and the leaves of the <i>Cordia sebastina</i> or <i>etou</i> tree. The
patterns were in this bright scarlet on a yellow ground;
formerly they were altogether devoid of uniformity or regularity,
yet exhibited a considerable degree of taste. The
bales of bark-cloth were sometimes as much as two hundred
yards long by four yards wide; the whole bale was in a
single piece, being composed of narrow strips joined together
by being beaten with grooved mallets. A chief's wealth was
sometimes estimated by the number of bales which he
possessed; the more valuable sort, covered with matting
or cloth of an inferior sort, were generally hung from the
roof of his house. The manufacture of cloth was chiefly in
the hands of women; indeed it was one of their most usual
employments. Even women of high rank did not disdain
this form of industry; the wives and daughters of chiefs
took a pride in manufacturing cloth of a superior quality,
excelling that produced by common women in the elegance
of the patterns or the brilliance of the dyes. Every family
had a little house where the females laboured at the making
of cloth; but in addition every district had a sort of public
factory, consisting of a spacious house where immense quantities
of cloth were produced on the occasion of festivals,
the visits of great chiefs, or other solemnities. In such a
factory the women would often assemble to the number
of two or three hundred, and the monotonous din of
their hammers falling on the bark was almost deafening;
it began early in the morning, only to cease at night.
Yet heard at a distance in some lonely valley the sound
was not disagreeable, telling as it did of industry and
peace.<a name="FNanchor_10_627" id="FNanchor_10_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_627" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Among the other articles manufactured by the Society
Islanders before the advent of Europeans were fine mats,
baskets of many different patterns, ropes, lines, and fishing-tackle,
including nets, hooks, and harpoons made of cane
and pointed with hard wood. In every expedient for taking
fish they are said to have been exceedingly ingenious.<a name="FNanchor_11_628" id="FNanchor_11_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_628" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
They made bows and arrows, with which, as an amusement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
they shot against each other, not at a mark, but to see who
could shoot farthest. Like the rest of the Polynesians, they
never used these weapons in war.<a name="FNanchor_12_629" id="FNanchor_12_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_629" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Society among these islanders was divided into three
ranks; first the royal family and nobility (<i>hui arii</i>); second,
the landed proprietors, or gentry and farmers (<i>bue raatira</i>);
and third, the common people (<i>manahune</i>). Of these, the
landed gentry and farmers were the most numerous and
influential class, constituting at all times the great body of
the people and the strength of the nation, as well as of the
army. The petty farmers owned from twenty to a hundred
acres. Some of the great landowners possessed many hundreds
of acres, and being surrounded by retainers they constituted
the aristocracy of the country and imposed a
restraint upon the king, who, without their co-operation,
could carry but few of his measures. They also frequently
acted as priests in their family temples. The
common people comprised slaves and servants. The slaves
were captives taken in war. Their treatment was in
general mild, and if peace continued, they often regained
their freedom and were allowed to return to their own
country.<a name="FNanchor_13_630" id="FNanchor_13_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_630" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The government of the Society Islands, like that of
Hawaii, was at least in form an arbitrary monarchy. The
supreme authority was vested in the king and was hereditary
in his family. It partook of a sacred character, for in these
islands government was closely interwoven with religion;
the king sometimes personated the god and received the
homage and prayers of the worshippers; at other times he
officiated as high-priest and transmitted the vows and
petitions of the people to the superior deities. The genealogy
of the reigning family was usually traced back to the first
ages of the world: in some of the islands the kings were
believed to be descended from the gods: their persons were
always sacred, and their families constituted the highest
rank recognised by the people.<a name="FNanchor_14_631" id="FNanchor_14_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_631" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, everything in the least degree connected with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the king or queen&mdash;the cloth they wore, the houses in
which they dwelt, the canoes in which they voyaged, the
men who carried them when they journeyed by land&mdash;became
sacred and could not be converted to common use.
The very sounds in the language which composed their
names could no longer be appropriated to ordinary significations.
If on the accession of a king any words in the
language were found to resemble his name, they were
abolished and changed for others; and if any man were
bold enough to continue to use them, not only he but all
his relations were immediately put to death; and the same
severity was exercised on any who should dare to apply the
sacred name to an animal. Thus in process of time the
original names of most common objects in the language
underwent considerable alterations. No one might touch
the body of the king or queen; nay, any person who should
so much as stand over them, or pass his hand over their
heads, was liable to pay for the sacrilege with the forfeiture
of his life. The very ground on which the king or queen
even accidentally trod became sacred; and any house
belonging to a private person which they entered must
for ever be vacated by the owner and either set apart
for the use of the royal personages or burnt down with
every part of its furniture. Hence it was a general rule
that the king and queen never entered any dwellings
except such as were specially dedicated to their use, and
never trod on the ground in any part of the island but
their own hereditary districts. In journeying they were
always carried on men's shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_15_632" id="FNanchor_15_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_632" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The inauguration of a king consisted in girding him
with a sacred girdle (<i>maro ura</i>) of red, or red and yellow,
feathers, which not only raised him to the highest earthly
station, but identified him with the gods. The red feathers
were taken from the images of the gods and interwoven with
feathers of other colours. A human victim was sacrificed
when they began to make the girdle, and another was
sacrificed when it was finished; sometimes others were
slaughtered at intermediate stages, one for each fresh piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
added to the girdle. The blood of the victims was supposed
to consecrate the belt.<a name="FNanchor_16_633" id="FNanchor_16_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_633" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The deification of kings in their lifetime would seem
not to have been confined to Tahiti, but to have prevailed
in the other islands of the Society Archipelago. We hear
particularly of the divinity of the kings of Raiatea. In
that island a place called Opoa is said to have been the
metropolis of idolatry for all the South Pacific Islands
within a compass of five hundred miles. Hither, from every
shore, human victims, already slain, were sent to be offered
on the altar of the war-god Oro, whose principal image was
there worshipped. There, too, was the residence of the
kings of the island, "who, beside the prerogatives of royalty,
enjoyed divine honours, and were in fact living idols among
the dead ones, being deified at the time of their accession
to political supremacy here. In the latter character, we
presume, it was, that these sovereigns (who always took the
name of Tamatoa) were wont to receive presents from the
kings and chiefs of adjacent and distant islands, whose gods
were all considered tributary to the Oro of Raiatea, and
their princes owing homage to its monarch, who was Oro's
hereditary high-priest, as well as an independent divinity
himself."<a name="FNanchor_17_634" id="FNanchor_17_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_634" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Of one particular monarch of this line, Tamatoa
by name, we read that he "had been enrolled among the
gods," and that "as one of the divinities of his subjects,
therefore, the king was worshipped, consulted as an oracle,
and had sacrifices and prayers offered to him."<a name="FNanchor_18_635" id="FNanchor_18_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_635" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>In the succession to the throne the law of primogeniture
prevailed, and in accordance with a singular usage, which
was invariably observed, the king regularly abdicated on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
birth of his first son and became a subject of his infant
offspring. The child was at once proclaimed the sovereign
of the people: the royal title was conferred on him; and
his own father was the first to do him homage by saluting
his feet and declaring him king. The public herald was
despatched round the island with the flag of the infant
monarch: in every district he unfurled the banner and
proclaimed the accession of the youthful sovereign. The
insignia of royalty and the homage of the people were at
once transferred from the father to the child: the royal
domains and other sources of revenue were appropriated to
the maintenance of the household of the infant ruler; and
the father paid him all the marks of reverence and submission
which he had hitherto exacted from the people.
However, during the minority of his son the former king
appears to have filled the office of regent. This remarkable
rule of succession was not limited to the royal house, but
prevailed also in noble families: no sooner did a baron's
wife give birth to a child than the baron was reduced to the
rank of a private man, though he continued to administer
the estate for the benefit of the infant, to whom all the
outward marks of honour were now transferred.<a name="FNanchor_19_636" id="FNanchor_19_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_636" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 3. <i>The Religion of the Society Islanders</i></h4>

<p>If religion consists essentially in a fear of gods, the
natives of the Society Islands were a very religious people,
for they believed in a multitude of gods and stood in
constant dread of them. "Whatever attention," says Ellis,
"the Tahitians paid to their occupations or amusements, and
whatever energies have been devoted to the prosecution of
their barbarous wars, the claims of all were regarded as
inferior to those of their religion. On this every other was
dependent, while each was alike made subservient to its
support."<a name="FNanchor_20_637" id="FNanchor_20_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_637" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> "No people in the world, in ancient or modern
times, appear to have been more superstitious than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
South Sea Islanders, or to have been more entirely under
the influence of dread from imaginary demons, or supernatural
beings. They had not only their major, but their
minor demons, or spirits, and all the minute ramifications of
idolatry."<a name="FNanchor_21_638" id="FNanchor_21_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_638" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> "Religious rites were connected with almost
every act of their lives. An <i>ubu</i> or prayer was offered
before they ate their food, when they tilled their ground,
planted their gardens, built their houses, launched their
canoes, cast their nets, and commenced or concluded a
journey. The first fish taken periodically on their shores,
together with a number of kinds regarded as sacred, were
conveyed to the altar. The first-fruits of their orchards and
gardens were also <i>taumaha</i>, or offered, with a portion of their
live-stock, which consisted of pigs, dogs, and fowls, as it was
supposed death would be inflicted on the owner or the
occupant of the land, from which the god should not receive
such acknowledgment."<a name="FNanchor_22_639" id="FNanchor_22_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_639" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Different gods were worshipped in different islands, and
even in different parts of the same island,<a name="FNanchor_23_640" id="FNanchor_23_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_640" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and if a deity
failed to answer the expectations of his worshippers, they
did not scruple to change him for another. In Captain
Cook's time the people of Tiaraboo (Tairaboo), the southern
peninsula of Tahiti, discarded their two old divinities and
adopted in their place Oraa, the god of the island of Bolabola
(Borabora), apparently because the people of Bolabola
had lately been victorious in war; and as, after this change
of deity, they themselves proved very successful in their
operations against their enemies, they imputed the success
entirely to their new god, who, they literally said, fought
their battles.<a name="FNanchor_24_641" id="FNanchor_24_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_641" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Again, when the prayers and offerings for
the recovery of a sick chief were unavailing, the god was
regarded as inexorable, and was usually banished from the
temple, and his image destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_25_642" id="FNanchor_25_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_642" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The pantheon and mythology of the Society Islands
were of the usual Polynesian type; some of their chief gods
were recognised and worshipped under the same names,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
with dialectical differences, in other islands of the Pacific.
In the beginning they say that all things were in a state of
chaos or darkness, from which the principal deities, including
Taaroa, Oro, and Tane, at last emerged. Hence these high
gods were said to be born of Night or the primaeval darkness
(<i>Po</i>). Among them all the first place in time and dignity
was generally assigned to Taaroa, who appears in other
parts of Polynesia as Tanaroa, Tangaroa, Tagaloa, and so
on. By some he was spoken of as the progenitor of the
other gods and as the creator of the heavens, the earth, and
sea, as well as of men, beasts, birds, and fishes; but others
were of opinion that the land or the world had existed
before the gods. Oro, the great national god of Tahiti,
Raiatea, and other islands, was believed to be a son of
Taaroa.<a name="FNanchor_26_643" id="FNanchor_26_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_643" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> To these three great gods, Oro, Tane, and Taaroa,
the people sacrificed in great emergencies, when the deities
were thought to be angry. At such times the wrath of the
god was revealed to a priest, who, wrapt up like a ball in
a bundle of cloth, spoke in a sharp, shrill, squeaky voice,
saying, "I am angry; bring me hogs, kill a man, and my
anger will be appeased."<a name="FNanchor_27_644" id="FNanchor_27_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_644" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Oro is sometimes described as the war-god.<a name="FNanchor_28_645" id="FNanchor_28_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_645" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The great
seat of his worship was at Opoa in the island of Raiatea:
his principal image was worshipped there "with the most
bloody and detestable rites"; and thither human victims,
ready slain, were sent from every shore to be offered on his
altar.<a name="FNanchor_29_646" id="FNanchor_29_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_646" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Sometimes, instead of the bodies of the slain, only
their jaw-bones were sent to decorate the temple of Oro at
Opoa; long strings of these relics might be seen hanging
about the sacred edifice.<a name="FNanchor_30_647" id="FNanchor_30_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_647" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In the small island of Tahaa, off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Raiatea, there was a temple (<i>marae</i>) dedicated to Oro and
his two daughters. It belonged to the king and "was
upheld for the convenience of finding a pretext to get rid,
from time to time, of obnoxious persons, of both sexes;
the men slain by assassination, or in war, being presented to
the male idol, and the women to his female progeny, who
were held to be as cruelly delighted with blood as their
parent. But the human sacrifices brought hither were not
allowed to remain and infect the atmosphere. When they
had lain upon the altar till they became offensive, the
carcases were transported to Oro's metropolitan temple at
Opoa, in Raiatea, which was the common Golgotha of his
victims."<a name="FNanchor_31_648" id="FNanchor_31_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_648" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Oro was said to have instituted the notorious Society
of the Areois, a licentious fraternity of strolling players and
mountebanks, who roamed about in troupes from island to
island, everywhere entertaining the populace by their shows,
which comprised recitations, songs, dramatic performances,
wrestling matches, and especially dances, which were often
of a lascivious character.<a name="FNanchor_32_649" id="FNanchor_32_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_649" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> These exhibitions, which were
witnessed by crowds and appear to have been the most
popular amusement of the islanders, were given in large,
substantial, sometimes highly ornamented, houses, which were
erected chiefly for the purpose of lodging these itinerant
performers, and providing them with suitable places for their
performances.<a name="FNanchor_33_650" id="FNanchor_33_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_650" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The first missionaries describe how, in a long
native house where they lodged for the night, they saw the
Areois men and women dancing and singing till near midnight:
so great were their numbers that they made the
house appear like a village.<a name="FNanchor_34_651" id="FNanchor_34_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_651" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Sometimes, apparently, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
performances took place in front of the house, the musicians,
singers, and reciters occupying a sort of stage, while the
actors or dancers performed on a place marked out for them
on the ground or on the floor.<a name="FNanchor_35_652" id="FNanchor_35_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_652" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The subject of their songs
or recitations was often a legend of the gods, or of some
distinguished member of the Society, which was chanted
or recited by the performers in chorus seated in a circle on
the ground, while the leader stood in the centre and introduced
the recitation with a sort of prologue, accompanied by
antic gestures and attitudes.<a name="FNanchor_36_653" id="FNanchor_36_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_653" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In these recitals the tales
often turned on romantic and diverting episodes in the lives
of ancestors or of deities. "Many of these were very long,
and regularly composed, so as to be repeated verbatim, or
with such illustrations only as the wit or fancy of the
narrator might have the skill to introduce. Their captain
on public occasions, was placed cross-legged on a stool seven
feet high, with a fan in his hand, in the midst of the circle
of laughing or admiring auditors, whom he delighted with
his drollery, or transported with his grimaces, being, in fact,
the merry-andrew of the corps, who, like a wise fool, well
knew how to turn his folly to the best account."<a name="FNanchor_37_654" id="FNanchor_37_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_654" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The Society of the Areois was wealthy and highly
esteemed; members were drawn from all social ranks and
greatly prided themselves on belonging to it.<a name="FNanchor_38_655" id="FNanchor_38_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_655" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Indeed, they
were regarded as a sort of superhuman beings, closely
allied to the gods, and were treated with a corresponding
degree of veneration by many of the vulgar and ignorant.<a name="FNanchor_39_656" id="FNanchor_39_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_656" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
They were divided into seven ranks or classes, the members
of which were distinguished from each other by their tattoo
marks; the greater the amount of the tattooing, the higher
the rank of the person.<a name="FNanchor_40_657" id="FNanchor_40_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_657" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Admission to the Society was
attended by a variety of ceremonies; a protracted noviciate
followed, and it was only by progressive advancement that
any were promoted to the higher dignities. It was imagined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
that those who became Areois were prompted or inspired
by the gods to take this step. A candidate for admission,
therefore, repaired to one of the public exhibitions in that
apparent state of frenzy which is commonly supposed to
indicate divine inspiration. His face was dyed scarlet; his
hair was perfumed and adorned with flowers, and he wore a
girdle of yellow plantain leaves. Thus arrayed, he rushed
through the crowd assembled round the house in which the
actors or dancers were performing, and, leaping into the circle,
joined with seeming frantic wildness in the dance or pantomime.
If the Society approved of him, they appointed him to wait
as a servant on the principal Areois, and after a period of
probation he might be inducted into the Society as a full-fledged
member. At his induction, which took place in a
great assembly of the body, the candidate received a new
name, by which he was thenceforth known in the Society.<a name="FNanchor_41_658" id="FNanchor_41_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_658" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
When a member was advanced from a lower to a higher
grade, the ceremony was performed at a public festival
which all the members of the Society in the island were
expected to attend. The candidate was then taken to a
temple, where he was solemnly anointed with fragrant oil
on the forehead, and offered a pig to the god.<a name="FNanchor_42_659" id="FNanchor_42_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_659" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>When a member of the Society died his body was
conveyed by the Areois to the grand temple, where the
bones of the kings were deposited. There the priest of Oro,
standing over the corpse, offered a long prayer to his god.
This prayer, and the ceremonies accompanying it, were
designed to divest the body of all the sacred and mysterious
influence which the deceased was thought to have received
from the god at the moment when, in the presence of the
idol, the perfumed oil had been sprinkled on him, and he had
been raised to the order or rank in which he died. By this
act they supposed that the sacred influence was restored to
Oro, by whom it had been imparted. The body was then
buried, like that of a common man, within the precincts of the
temple, in which the mortal remains of chiefs were interred.<a name="FNanchor_43_660" id="FNanchor_43_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_660" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
But if for any reason the corpse were buried in unconsecrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
ground, the ghost would appear to a survivor next day and
remonstrate with him, saying, "You have buried me in
common earth, and so long as I lie there, I cannot go to
heaven. You must bury me with ceremonies, and in holy
ground." After that the corpse was disinterred, and having
been doubled up by tying the arms to the shoulders and
the knees to the trunk, it was buried in a sitting posture
in a hole so shallow that the earth barely covered the
head. This was esteemed the most honourable form of
sepulture, and was principally confined to personages of
high rank.<a name="FNanchor_44_661" id="FNanchor_44_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_661" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The Areoi Society comprised women as well as men,<a name="FNanchor_45_662" id="FNanchor_45_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_662" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
but the accounts given of the proportion of the sexes and
their relations to each other are conflicting. According to
one account, the male members outnumbered the women as
five to one.<a name="FNanchor_46_663" id="FNanchor_46_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_663" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The first missionaries reported that the Areois
were said to have each two or three wives, whom they
exchanged with each other.<a name="FNanchor_47_664" id="FNanchor_47_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_664" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> According to Cook, every
woman was common to every man<a name="FNanchor_48_665" id="FNanchor_48_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_665" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>; and Turnbull affirmed
that the community of women was the very principle of their
union.<a name="FNanchor_49_666" id="FNanchor_49_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_666" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> On the other hand, the naturalist George Forster,
who accompanied Captain Cook, observes: "We have been
told a wanton tale of promiscuous embraces, where every
woman is common to every man: but when we enquired for a
confirmation of this story from the natives, we were soon
convinced that it must, like many others, be considered as
the groundless invention of a traveller's gay fancy."<a name="FNanchor_50_667" id="FNanchor_50_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_667" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Again,
Ellis observes that, "although addicted to every kind of
licentiousness themselves, each Areoi had his own wife, who
was also a member of the Society; and so jealous were they
in this respect, that improper conduct towards the wife of
one of their own number, was sometimes punished with
death."<a name="FNanchor_51_668" id="FNanchor_51_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_668" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Yet the same writer speaks of "the mysteries of
iniquity, and acts of more than bestial degradation" to which
the Areois were at times addicted; and he says that "in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
some of their meetings, they appear to have placed their invention
on the rack, to discover the worst pollutions of which it
was possible for man to be guilty, and to have striven to outdo
each other in the most revolting practices."<a name="FNanchor_52_669" id="FNanchor_52_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_669" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>It was a rule of the Society that no member should have
any children; hence the first injunction given to a new
member was to murder his offspring. Any infant that
might afterwards be born to him was strangled at birth.<a name="FNanchor_53_670" id="FNanchor_53_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_670" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> If
a woman spared her child and could induce a man to father
it, "both the man and the woman, being deemed by this act
to have appropriated each other, are ejected from the
community, and forfeit all claim to the privileges and
pleasures of Arreoy for the future; the woman from that
time being distinguished by the term <i>whannow-now</i>, 'bearer
of children,' which is here a term of reproach."<a name="FNanchor_54_671" id="FNanchor_54_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_671" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The pretext
alleged by the Areois for this cruel practice was that, on the
institution of the Society by the god Oro, the first two
members, Orotetefa and Urutetefa, brothers of the god, had
been celibate and childless, and that therefore the members
of the Society were bound to imitate them by being also
without offspring.<a name="FNanchor_55_672" id="FNanchor_55_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_672" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>In the constant repetition of their often obscene exhibitions
the Areois passed their lives, sailing from island to island
or strolling from one chief's house to that of another, where
they renewed the same round of dances, wrestlings, and
pantomimic performances.<a name="FNanchor_56_673" id="FNanchor_56_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_673" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> But the labour and drudgery of
dancing and performing for the amusement of the spectators
devolved chiefly on the lowest members of the Society, who
were the principal actors in all their shows, while the higher
orders, though they plastered themselves with charcoal and
stained themselves scarlet like their humbler brethren, were
generally careful not to contribute to the public hilarity by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
any exhausting efforts of their own. Thus they led a life of
dissipation and luxurious indolence.<a name="FNanchor_57_674" id="FNanchor_57_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_674" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>They seem to have moved about in great troupes. As
many as seventy canoes, with more than seven hundred of
these vagabonds on board, have been seen steering from
island to island.<a name="FNanchor_58_675" id="FNanchor_58_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_675" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The approach of such a fleet to the shore
with drums beating, flutes playing, and streamers floating on
the wind, was a picturesque sight, and as the canoes neared
the land the dancers might be seen jigging it on stages
erected on board, while the voices of the singers mingled
with the roll of the drums, the shrill music of the flutes, and
the roar of the surf on the beach in a confused but not
unmelodious babel of sound.<a name="FNanchor_59_676" id="FNanchor_59_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_676" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>On landing in an island their first business was to take
a small sucking-pig to the temple and present it to the god
as a thank-offering to him for having brought them safe
to shore. This, we are told, was the only sacrifice ever
offered in token of gratitude by any of the South Sea
Islanders to their imaginary divinities.<a name="FNanchor_60_677" id="FNanchor_60_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_677" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> While they were
everywhere welcomed by the vulgar for the merriment they
carried with them, and were everywhere countenanced and
liberally entertained by the kings and chiefs, who found them
convenient tools of fraud and oppression, they were not
received with equal enthusiasm by the farmers, who had
to furnish them with provisions, and who durst not refuse
them anything, however unreasonable and extortionate their
demands. For the Areois lived on the fat of the land. When
they alighted, like a swarm of locusts, on a rich district, they
would send out their henchmen to scour the neighbourhood
and plunder the miserable inhabitants; and when they
moved on to their next halting-place, the gardens which they
left behind them often presented a scene of desolation and
ruin.<a name="FNanchor_61_678" id="FNanchor_61_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_678" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Such havoc, indeed, did they spread by their feastings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and carousings on even a short visit of a few days, that in
some parts of Tahiti the natives were compelled to abandon
the fertile lowlands and retreat up the mountains, submitting
to the trouble of clambering up almost inaccessible slopes
and cultivating a less fruitful soil rather than expose much of
the produce of their labour to the ravages of these privileged
robbers.<a name="FNanchor_62_679" id="FNanchor_62_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_679" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Not the least of the privileges, real or imaginary,
enjoyed by the Areois was that after death their spirits
were believed to pass without difficulty to that paradise of
delights to which otherwise none but the noble and wealthy
could hope to attain.<a name="FNanchor_63_680" id="FNanchor_63_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_680" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the profligate life which the Areoi led and
their addiction to a round of frivolous amusements and
entertainments, it seems likely that the Society was originally
founded for some serious purpose, though the accounts
which have come down to us hardly enable us to determine,
or even to conjecture with a fair degree of probability, what
that purpose was. That its aim was religious might be
inferred on general grounds, and is confirmed by the close
relation in which the Society stood to the national god Oro.
Not only is Oro said to have founded the Society, but before
a troop of Areois set out on their peregrinations they were
obliged to kill many pigs in sacrifice to him and to offer
large quantities of plantains, bananas, and other fruits on his
altars. Moreover, temporary shrines were erected in their
canoes for the worship of Oro's two divine brothers, Orotetefa
and Urutetefa, who were traditionally said to have been the
first members of the Society and were regarded as its tutelary
deities. In these shrines the principal symbols were a stone
for each of the brothers taken from Oro's temple, and a few
red feathers from the inside of his sacred image. Into these
symbols the gods were supposed to enter when the priest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
pronounced a short prayer immediately before the sailing of
the fleet.<a name="FNanchor_64_681" id="FNanchor_64_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_681" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>We might be better able to understand the purpose and
the functions of the Areoi Society if we were acquainted
with the nature and meaning which the natives ascribed to
the god Oro, the reputed founder of the Society; but on this
subject our authorities shed little light. He is described as
the war-god<a name="FNanchor_65_682" id="FNanchor_65_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_682" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and as "the great national idol of Raiatea,
Tahiti, Eimeo, and some of the other islands," and he was
said to be a son of the creator Taaroa, who at first dwelt
alone up aloft, but who afterwards, with the help of his
daughter Hina, created the heavens, the earth, and the sea.<a name="FNanchor_66_683" id="FNanchor_66_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_683" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
By European writers Oro has been variously interpreted as a
god of the dead or of the sun; and accordingly the Society
of the Areois has been variously explained as devoted either
to a cult of the Lord of the Dead for the sake of securing
eternal happiness in a world beyond the grave, or to a
worship of the sun-god; but the grounds alleged for either
interpretation appear to be extremely slight.<a name="FNanchor_67_684" id="FNanchor_67_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_684" class="fnanchor">[67]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps a faint gleam of light may fall on the mystery
of the Areois from an examination of their traditionary
first members and guardian deities, the two divine brothers,
Orotetefai and Urutetefai. The similarity of the names of
the brothers suggests that they may have been twins; for it
is a common custom to bestow either the same or a similar
name on each of a pair of twins in order to indicate their
close relationship to each other.<a name="FNanchor_68_685" id="FNanchor_68_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_685" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> If they were twins, there
are some grounds for thinking that they were Heavenly
Twins; for their father or creator, Taaroa, seems certainly
to have been a sky-god, and their mother, Hina, is by some
authorities regarded as the moon; moreover, the two brothers
are said to have first descended from the sky to the earth
on a rainbow.<a name="FNanchor_69_686" id="FNanchor_69_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_686" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> If the twinship of the divine brothers could
be made out, it might perhaps explain some of the peculiar
features of the Areoi Society. For example, their remarkable
custom of not allowing any of their offspring to live;
for it has been a common custom in many parts of the
world to put twins to death.<a name="FNanchor_70_687" id="FNanchor_70_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_687" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Further, the superhuman
rank accorded to the Areois becomes more intelligible on
this hypothesis. For among many savage peoples twins
are credited with the possession of powers superior to those
of ordinary humanity; in particular, they are thought to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
able to influence the weather for good or evil, as by causing
rain or drought and the wind to blow or be still.<a name="FNanchor_71_688" id="FNanchor_71_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_688" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Among
the Baronga of South-Eastern Africa the supposed relation
of twins to the sky is very clearly marked. They call the
mother of twins by a name which means "Heaven" (<i>Tilo</i>),
and consistently they style the twins themselves "Children
of Heaven" (<i>Bana ba Tilo</i>).<a name="FNanchor_72_689" id="FNanchor_72_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_689" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The mother is even said to
have "made Heaven," to have "carried Heaven," and to
have "ascended to Heaven."<a name="FNanchor_73_690" id="FNanchor_73_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_690" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The connexion which is
believed to exist between her and the twins on the one side
and the sky on the other is brought out plainly in the
customs which the Baronga observe for the purpose of procuring
rain in time of drought. Thus they will take a
mother of twins, put her in a hole, and pour on her water
which they have drawn from all the wells, till the hole is
half full, and the water comes up to her breast. This is
thought to make the rain fall.<a name="FNanchor_74_691" id="FNanchor_74_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_691" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Or again, in order to get
rain, the women will strip themselves naked except for a
girdle and head-dress of grass, and thus attired will go in
procession, headed by a mother of twins, and pour water on
the graves of twins. And if the body of a twin has been
buried in dry ground, they will dig it up and bury it again
near a river; for the grave of a twin, in their opinion, should
always be wet. Thus they hope to draw down rain on the
thirsty ground.<a name="FNanchor_75_692" id="FNanchor_75_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_692" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Again, when a thunderstorm is raging
and lightning threatens to strike a village, the Baronga will
say to a twin, "Help us! you are a Child of Heaven! You
can therefore cope with Heaven; it will hear you when you
speak." So the child goes out of the hut and prays to
Heaven as follows: "Go away! Do not annoy us! We
are afraid. Go and roar far away." When the thunderstorm
is over, the child is thanked for its services. The
mother of twins is also supposed to be able to help in
the same way, for has she not, as the natives express it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
ascended to Heaven? They say that she can speak with
Heaven, and that she is at it or in it.<a name="FNanchor_76_693" id="FNanchor_76_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_693" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Among the Kpelle,
a negro tribe of Liberia, twins are regarded as born magicians,
and as such are treated with respect, and people sometimes
make them presents in order to ensure their goodwill; in
doing so they are careful never to make a present to the one
twin without the other, and the twin who was born last gets
his present first, for he is regarded as the first-born. Twins
are thought by the Kpelle to do wonders; they even say that
"a twin surpasses every medicine-man."<a name="FNanchor_77_694" id="FNanchor_77_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_694" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Among the Fan
or Fang, a tribe of the Cameroons in West Africa, there is
a curious superstition that a twin ought not to see a rainbow.
Should he by accident have caught sight of one, he must
shave his eyebrows and dye the place of the one black
and the place of the other red.<a name="FNanchor_78_695" id="FNanchor_78_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_695" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> This superstition seems to
imply a special relation between twins and the sky, and it
reminds us of the Tahitian tradition that the two divine
brothers, the first members of the Areoi Society, descended
to earth on a rainbow.<a name="FNanchor_79_696" id="FNanchor_79_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_696" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Another notion about twins which may possibly help to
throw light on some of the practices of the Areoi Society, is
that they or their parents or both are endowed with a
fertilising or prolific virtue, which enables them to multiply
animals or plants and thereby to increase the food supply.
Thus, for example, some tribes of Northern Rhodesia keep
pigeons in their villages, and in erecting a pigeon-cote they
take care that the first stakes "are driven in by a woman
who has borne twins, in order, they say, that the pigeons
may multiply."<a name="FNanchor_80_697" id="FNanchor_80_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_697" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Some Bantu tribes of this region ascribe
a similar virtue to both the father and the mother of twins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
They think that such parents exert a beneficial or prolific
influence at laying the foundations of pigeon-cotes, chicken-houses,
goat-pens, or any other building used for the purposes
of breeding; a certain woman who had borne twins thrice
was lately in great request at these functions.<a name="FNanchor_81_698" id="FNanchor_81_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_698" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The Zulus
think that all goats belonging to a twin bring forth young
in couples.<a name="FNanchor_82_699" id="FNanchor_82_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_699" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>In the Central District of Busoga, Central Africa, when
a woman has given birth to twins, the people of her clan
do not sow any seed until the twins have been brought to
the field. A pot of cooked grain is set before the children
with a cake of sesame and all the seed that is to be sown.
The food is eaten by the assembled people, and afterwards
the field is sown in presence of the twins; the plot is then
said to be the field of the twins. The mother of twins
must sow her seed before any person of the clan will sow
his or hers.<a name="FNanchor_83_700" id="FNanchor_83_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_700" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> These customs seem clearly to imply a belief
that twins and their mother possess a special power of
fertilising the seed. Among the Baganda of Central Africa
twins were supposed to be sent by Mukasa, the great god
whose blessing on the crops and on the people was ensured
at an annual festival. The twins were thought to be under
the protection of the god, and they bore his name, the
boys being called Mukasa and the girls Namukasa. And
a series of customs observed by the parents of twins among
the Baganda indicates in the plainest manner a belief that
they were endowed with a fertilising virtue which extended,
not only to the crops and the cattle, but also to human
beings. Thus the parents of twins were supposed to make
people fruitful by sprinkling them with a mixture of water
and clay from pots, of which each of the parents had one.
Again, some time after the birth the parents used to make
a round of visits to relations and friends, taking the twins
with them. At every house they danced, the father wearing
a crown made from a certain creeper, and the mother wearing
a girdle of the same material. At these dances offerings
were made to the twins. These dances were most popular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
"because the people believed that thereby they obtained a
special blessing from the god Mukasa, who favoured the
parents of twins, and through them dispensed blessing
wherever they went." The persons whom the twins and
their parents honoured with a visit "thought that, not only
they themselves would be blessed and given children, but
that their herds and crops also would be multiplied." A
ceremony performed by the father and mother of twins over
a flower of the plantain indicated in the plainest, if the
grossest, fashion the belief of the Baganda that parents of
twins could magically fertilise the plantains which form the
staple food of the people. No wonder, then, that among
them a mother of twins is deemed a source of blessing to
the whole community, and that for some time after the
birth both she and the father were sacred and wore a distinctive
dress to prevent any one from touching them. The
father, in particular, "could do what he liked, because he
was under the protection of the god"; for example, he was
free to enter anybody's garden and to take the produce at
will. Special drums, too, were made for the parents, one
for the father and one for the mother; and for some time
after the birth these were beaten continually both by day
and by night.<a name="FNanchor_84_701" id="FNanchor_84_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_701" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Among the Hos of Togo, in West Africa, in like manner,
special drums are beaten for the parents of twins, and the
parents dance publicly to the music in the main street of
the village, after going nine times round it. Some days
later the parents go the round of all the Ho towns, everywhere
executing the same dance to the same music at noon;
but should one of the twins have died in the meantime, the
parents dance at night. It is believed that, if the customary
rites were not performed at the birth of twins, the parents
of the twins would be crippled. Curiously enough, the
drums, to the music of which the parents dance, may not
be beaten by any one without special reason; and no one
else may dance to their music except such as have slain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
either a man or a leopard. Among these people the birth
of twins is the occasion of very great rejoicing. They say
that "the road which the mother of twins goes is better
than the road which the rich man goes."<a name="FNanchor_85_702" id="FNanchor_85_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_702" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The saying
suggests that the Hos, like the Baganda, regard a mother
of twins as diffusing fertility wherever she goes; and, on
the analogy of the dances of parents of twins among the
Baganda, we may conjecture that in like manner among the
Hos the parents of twins are supposed to confer the blessing
of fruitfulness on all the towns where they dance.</p>

<p>Among the Barundi of East Africa the birth of twins
is celebrated with rites, songs, and ritual dances, which last
for days and even for weeks. As soon as the news spreads,
the neighbours, friends, and relations flock to the house to
sing, bringing with them presents for the parents or offerings
to the spirits. The amount of provisions thus accumulated
is enormous, but the parents of the twins benefit little by
it; the great bulk disappears as by magic among the self-invited
guests. Festivity, dancing, and singing are now the
order of the day. Dancers, male and female, their faces
painted red and white or yellow, dance like furies in a circle
for hours together, singing ritual hymns at the top of their
voices, while an old sorceress besprinkles the troop with
lustral water. It is commonly believed that if these rites
were omitted, the twins and their parents would die. At
the birth of twins it is customary to buy two black sheep
or lambs and to dedicate them to the twins, one to each.
These sheep are then left at liberty to run about as they
like by day and night, and to enter the fields and browse
at will. If one of them dies it is replaced by another. The
animals are described as the guardians of the children, the
receptacle or symbol of their spirits, in short, as their fetish.<a name="FNanchor_86_703" id="FNanchor_86_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_703" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
To some extent, they are analogous to the pig which an
Areoi used to offer to the god at the ceremony of his
consecration; for, though sometimes the animal was killed,
at other times it was liberated, and, being regarded as sacred
or belonging to the god to whom it had been offered, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
allowed to range the district uncontrolled till it died.<a name="FNanchor_87_704" id="FNanchor_87_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_704" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
Among the Baluba, a tribe of the Belgian Congo, there is
great joy at the birth of twins, and special ceremonies are
observed on the occasion. The twins are invariably named
Kyunga and Kahya, after the spirits of two ancient kings,
and to these spirits the twins are consecrated. After being
washed and decorated they are placed side by side in a
winnowing-basket and carried by the women of the family
in procession through the village, headed by the proud
father. Dancing and singing they go to the ash-heap of
the village. There they all rub themselves with ashes and
perform another dance. After that, still led by the father
of the twins, they go to the houses of the chief people, and
in front of each house the father dances, while the women
beat time with their hands. Wherever the procession halts,
the householder is expected to come and admire the twins,
to compliment the father, and to deposit a small present in
the winnowing-basket.<a name="FNanchor_88_705" id="FNanchor_88_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_705" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Among the Herero of South-West
Africa the parents of twins are looked on as sacred, and for
a time they may not speak to any one, and no one may
speak to them. But after the lapse of some days the family
goes the round of the village, visiting three or four huts
every day. The father of the twins sits down on the right
side of the hut, and the inmates make him offerings of
beads, oxen, and so forth. When he has thus gone the
round of the village, he repairs to the neighbouring villages,
where the same ceremonies are repeated. It is often a year
before he returns to his own village, and when he does so
he brings back with him a great quantity of offerings.
Henceforth the father of the twins enjoys all the privileges
of a priestly chief; he may sacrifice at the holy fire, and he
may represent and even succeed the chief in the office of
priest for the village. The twins themselves are eligible for
the same office. If a chief dies a natural death, he is succeeded
in his priestly function by his twin son; whereas the
chieftainship passes to the chief's legal heir, who is properly
the son of his eldest sister, and who thenceforth assumes the
name of the twin. A twin is bound by no taboo; he may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
eat of all flesh offered in sacrifice; he may drink of the
milk of every holy cow, just like the chief and the priest
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_89_706" id="FNanchor_89_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_706" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>In these cases we are not told that twins and their
parents are supposed to be endowed with a power of
multiplying the herds and generally of increasing the supply
of food by the prolific influence which they diffuse about
them; but the analogy of the customs and beliefs of the
Baganda concerning the birth of twins renders the supposition
probable. At least on this hypothesis we can readily
understand the round of visits which the parents, or one of
them, pay to the surrounding towns or villages, and the
presents which are made to them. If they indeed possess
a power of imparting fertility and abundance wherever they
go, it is obviously in everybody's interest to be visited by
them, and clearly, on the same supposition, it is everybody's
duty to make some return to them for the wonderful benefits
which they have conferred.</p>

<p>Similarly we may perhaps suppose that the rounds which
the Areois went from island to island, dancing, singing, and
playing their tricks wherever they stopped, were believed to
quicken the fruits of the earth, and possibly also to multiply
the pigs and the fish. On that assumption, the unlimited
right which these vagabonds enjoyed of appropriating and
consuming the produce of the gardens was probably accorded
to them as a natural and proper remuneration for the inestimable
services which their mere presence was believed to
render to the crops. The sexual excesses, in which they
appear to have indulged, would also be intelligible, if it was
imagined that, on the principle of sympathetic magic, such
indulgences actually promoted the multiplication and growth
of plants and animals. But this explanation of the extravagant
rites observed by the Areois, and of the quaint beliefs
entertained concerning them, is offered only as an hypothesis
for what it is worth. It may be worth while noting that
among the Kpelle, a tribe of Liberia in West Africa, there
is reported to exist a Secret Society of Twins,<a name="FNanchor_90_707" id="FNanchor_90_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_707" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> but whether it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
bears any resemblance to the Society of the Areois I do not
know.</p>

<p>A familiar figure of the Polynesian pantheon, who meets
us in the mythology of the Society Islanders, was the famous
god or hero Maui. Many stories of his exploits were told
in the islands. It is said that originally the sky lay flat
upon the face of the earth and ocean, being held down by
the legs of a huge cuttle-fish. But Maui dived into the
sea, and, grappling with the monster, utterly dismembered
him; whereupon the sky flew up and expanded into the
beautiful blue vault which we now see above us, with the
noonday sun for the keystone of the arch.<a name="FNanchor_91_708" id="FNanchor_91_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_708" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Again, the
natives told how, one day, sitting in his canoe, Maui let down
his line with a hook at the end of it and fished up the earth,
which had hitherto lain at the bottom of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_92_709" id="FNanchor_92_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_709" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Also he
is said to have held the sun with ropes to prevent him from
going too fast.<a name="FNanchor_93_710" id="FNanchor_93_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_710" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> For it happened that Maui was hard at
work, building a temple, when he perceived that the day was
declining and that the night would overtake him before he
had accomplished his task; so hastily twining some ropes of
coco-nut fibre, he laid hold of the sun's rays and tethered
them by the ropes to a tree, so that the sun could not stir
till Maui had finished the task he was at.<a name="FNanchor_94_711" id="FNanchor_94_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_711" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Further, Maui is
said to have invented the mode of kindling fire by rubbing
the point of one stick in the groove of another,<a name="FNanchor_95_712" id="FNanchor_95_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_712" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> which was
the way in which the Society Islanders regularly made fire.<a name="FNanchor_96_713" id="FNanchor_96_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_713" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
Maui was also supposed to be the cause of earthquakes.<a name="FNanchor_97_714" id="FNanchor_97_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_714" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> In
Tahiti a curious image of Maui was seen and described by
Captain Cook. "It was the figure of a man, constructed of
basket-work, rudely made, but not ill-designed; it was something
more than seven feet high, and rather too bulky in
proportion to its height. The wicker skeleton was completely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
covered with feathers, which were white where the skin was
to appear, and black in the parts which it is their custom to
paint or stain, and upon the head, where there was to be a
representation of hair: upon the head also were four protuberances,
three in front and one behind, which we should
have called horns, but which the Indians dignified with the
name of <i>Tate Ete</i>, little men. The image was called Manioe,
and was said to be the only one in Otaheite. They attempted
to give us an explanation of its use and design, but we had
not then acquired enough of their language to understand
them. We learnt, however, afterwards that it was a representation
of Mauwe, one of their <i>Eatuas</i>, or gods of the second
class."<a name="FNanchor_98_715" id="FNanchor_98_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_715" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Besides the high primaeval deities, born of the Night, the
Society Islanders believed in a host of inferior divinities,
many of whom were said to have been created by Taaroa,
the supreme god. Thus, between the high gods and the
deities of particular places or of particular professions, there
was a class of intermediate deities, who were not supposed
to have existed from the beginning or to have been born of
Night. Their origin was veiled in obscurity, but they were
often described as having been renowned men, who, after
death, were deified by their descendants. They all received
the homage of the people, and on all public occasions were
acknowledged among the gods.<a name="FNanchor_99_716" id="FNanchor_99_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_716" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Again, there were many
gods of the sea, among whom the principal seem to have
been Tuaraatai and Ruahatu. These were generally called
shark gods (<i>atua mao</i>), not that the shark was itself deemed
a god, but that it was supposed to be employed by the
marine gods as their minister of vengeance. It was only the
large blue shark which was believed to act in this capacity;
and it is said that these voracious creatures always spared a
shipwrecked priest, even when they devoured his companions;
nay, they would recognise a priest on board any canoe, come
at his call, and retire at his bidding. A priest of one of
these shark gods told Mr. Ellis that he or his father had been
carried on the back of a shark from Raiatea to Huahine,
a distance of twenty miles. Other gods were thought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
preside over the fisheries, and to direct the shoals of fish to
the coasts. Their aid was invoked by fishermen before they
launched their canoes and while they were busy at sea. But
these marine deities were not supposed by the people to be
of equal antiquity with the great primordial gods, born of
the Night (<i>atua fauau po</i>).<a name="FNanchor_100_717" id="FNanchor_100_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_717" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Again, there were gods of the
air, who were sometimes worshipped under the figure of
birds. The chief of these aerial deities were thought to be
a brother and sister, who dwelt near the great rock, which is
the foundation of the world. There they imprisoned the
stormy winds, but sent them forth from time to time to
punish such as neglected the worship of the gods. In tempests
their compassion was besought by mariners tossed on the
sea or by their friends on shore.<a name="FNanchor_101_718" id="FNanchor_101_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_718" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> To the minds of the
islanders there were also gods of hill and dale, of precipice
and ravine. "By their rude mythology each lovely island
was made a sort of fairy-land, and the spells of enchantment
were thrown over its varied scenes.... The mountain's
summit, and the fleecy mists that hang upon its brows&mdash;the
rocky defile&mdash;the foaming cataract&mdash;and the lonely dell&mdash;were
all regarded as the abode or resort of these invisible
beings."<a name="FNanchor_102_719" id="FNanchor_102_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_719" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The general name for "god" in the Society Islands, as
throughout Polynesia, was <i>atua</i>.<a name="FNanchor_103_720" id="FNanchor_103_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_720" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The word was also applied,
in the expression <i>oramatuas</i> or <i>oromatuas</i>, to the spirits of
departed relatives, who were also worshipped and ranked
among the deities.<a name="FNanchor_104_721" id="FNanchor_104_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_721" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> To these we shall return presently;
meantime it may not be out of place to give some notice
of the worship of the other gods, since in the religion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
of the Society Islanders, as of other branches of the Polynesian
race, it was closely interwoven with the worship
of the dead.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4. <i>The Temples and Images of the Gods</i></h4>

<p>The sacred place dedicated to religious worship was called
a <i>morai</i>, or, as it is also spelled, a <i>marai</i> or <i>marae</i>, which
may be translated "temple," though all such places were
uncovered and open to the sky. The national temples,
where the principal idols were deposited, consisted of large
walled enclosures, some of which contained smaller inner
courts. The form was frequently that of a square or a
parallelogram, with sides forty or fifty feet long. The area
was paved with flat stones, and two sides of it were enclosed
by a high stone wall, while the front was protected by a low
fence, and within rose in steps or terraces a solid pyramidical
structure built of stone, which usually formed one of the
narrow sides of the area, either at the western or at the
eastern end. These pyramids, which were always truncated
so as to form a narrow platform or ridge on their upper
surface, were the most striking and characteristic feature of
the <i>morais</i>; indeed the name <i>morai</i> or <i>marae</i> appears to
have been sometimes confined, at least by European observers,
to the pyramid. In front of the pyramid the images were
kept and the altars fixed. The houses of the priests and of
the keepers of the idols were erected within the enclosure.<a name="FNanchor_105_722" id="FNanchor_105_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_722" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Of these interesting monuments, which seemed destined to
last for ages, only a few insignificant ruins survive; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
rest have been destroyed, chiefly at the instigation of the
missionaries.<a name="FNanchor_106_723" id="FNanchor_106_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_723" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Some of the pyramids erected within these sacred
enclosures were of great size. In Tahiti an enormous
one was seen and described by Captain Cook as well as
by later observers. It was of oblong shape and measured
two hundred and sixty-seven feet in length by eighty-seven
feet in width. It rose in a series of eleven steps or terraces,
each four feet high, so that the total height of the structure
was forty-four feet. Each step was formed of a single
course of white coral stone, neatly squared and polished.
The steps on the long sides were broader than those at
the ends, so that at the top it terminated, not in an oblong
of the same figure as the base, but in a ridge like the roof
of a house. The interior of the pyramid was solid, being
filled up with round pebbles which, from the regularity of
their figure, seemed to have been wrought. Some of the
coral stones were very large; one of them was three and
a half feet long by two and a half feet wide. The foundation
of the pyramid was built not of coral, but of what
Captain Cook called rock, by which he probably meant
a volcanic stone. These foundation stones were also
squared; one of them measured four feet seven inches
by two feet four inches. "Such a structure," says Captain
Cook, "raised without the assistance of iron tools to
shape the stones, or mortar to join them, struck us with
astonishment: it seemed to be as compact and firm as
it could have been made by any workman in Europe,
except that the steps which range along its greatest
length are not perfectly strait, but sink in a kind of
hollow in the middle, so that the whole surface, from
end to end, is not a right line, but a curve." All the
stones, both rock and coral, must have been brought from
a distance, for there was no quarry in the neighbourhood.
The squaring of these blocks with stone tools must, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Captain Cook observes, have been a work of incredible
labour; but the polishing of them could have been effected
more easily by means of the sharp coral sand, which is
found everywhere on the seashore in great abundance. On
the top of the pyramid, and about the middle, stood the
wooden image of a bird; and near it lay the image of a fish
carved in stone. This great pyramid formed part of one
side of a spacious area, nearly square, which measured three
hundred and sixty feet by three hundred and fifty-four,
and was walled in with stone as well as paved with flat
stones in its whole extent. Notwithstanding the pavement,
several trees were growing within the sacred enclosure.
About a hundred yards to the west was another paved
area or court, in which were several small stages raised on
wooden pillars about seven feet high. These stages the
natives called <i>ewattas</i>. Captain Cook judged them rightly
to be altars, observing that they supported what appeared
to be offerings in the shape of provisions of all sorts, as well
as whole hogs and many skulls of hogs and dogs.<a name="FNanchor_107_724" id="FNanchor_107_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_724" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The pyramids within the sacred enclosure were not
usually so large or so lofty. In the island of Huahine
the pyramid of the chief god Tani or Tane was a hundred
and twenty-four feet long by sixteen feet broad, and it had
only two steps or stories. The lower step or story was
about ten feet high and faced with blocks of coral, set on
their edges: some of these blocks were as high as the step
itself. The upper step or story was similarly faced with
coral, but was not more than three feet high. The interior
of both stories was filled with earth. In the centre of the
principal front stood the god's bed, a stone platform twenty-four
feet long by thirteen feet wide, but only eighteen inches
high. The style and masonry of this pyramid, as well as
its dimensions, appear to have been very inferior to those
of the great one in Tahiti. The blocks were apparently
unhewn and unpolished, the angles ill formed, and the walls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
not straight. Venerable and magnificent trees overshadowed
the sanctuary. One of them measured fifteen yards in
girth above the roots. It is said that the god often
wished to fly away, but that his long tail always caught
in the boughs of this giant tree and dragged him down
to earth again.<a name="FNanchor_108_725" id="FNanchor_108_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_725" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>These sacred pyramids "were erected in any place, and
at any time, when the priests required, by the slavish people.
On such occasions the former overlooked the latter at their
work, and denounced the most terrible judgments upon those
who were remiss at it. The poor wretches were thus compelled
to finish their tasks (burthensome as they often were,
in heaving blocks from the sea, dragging them ashore, and
heaping them one upon another) without eating, which would
have desecrated the intended sanctuary. To restrain the
gnawings of hunger they bound girdles of bark round their
bodies, tightening the ligatures from time to time, as their
stomachs shrank with emptiness. And, when the drudgery
was done, it was not uncommon for the remorseless priests
to seize one of the miserable builders and sacrifice him to
the idol of the place."<a name="FNanchor_109_726" id="FNanchor_109_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_726" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Temples of this sort were found scattered over the islands
in every situation&mdash;on hill-tops, on jutting headlands, and in
the recesses of groves.<a name="FNanchor_110_727" id="FNanchor_110_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_727" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> They varied greatly in size: some
were small and built in the rudest manner, mere squares of
ill-shapen and ill-piled stones. In the island of Borabora
the missionaries found not less than two hundred and twenty
of these structures crowded within an area only ten miles
in circumference.<a name="FNanchor_111_728" id="FNanchor_111_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_728" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The trees that grew within the sacred
enclosure were sacred. They comprised particularly the tall
cypress-like casuarina and the broader-leaved and more
exuberant callophyllum, thespesia, and cardia. Their interlacing
boughs formed a thick umbrageous covert, which often
excluded the rays of the sun; and the contrast between the
bright glare of a tropical day outside and the sombre
gloom in the depths of the grove, combined with the sight
of the gnarled trunks and twisted boughs of the aged trees,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
and the sighing of the wind in the branches, to strike a
religious horror into the mind of the beholder.<a name="FNanchor_112_729" id="FNanchor_112_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_729" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The ground
which surrounded the temples (<i>morais</i>) was sacred and
afforded a sanctuary for criminals. Thither they fled on
any apprehension of danger, especially when many human
sacrifices were expected, and thence they might not be
torn by violence, though they were sometimes seduced
from their asylum by guile.<a name="FNanchor_113_730" id="FNanchor_113_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_730" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>These remarkable sanctuaries were at once temples for
the worship of the gods and burial-places for the human
dead. On this combination of functions I have already
adduced some evidence;<a name="FNanchor_114_731" id="FNanchor_114_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_731" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> but as the point is important,
I will cite further testimonies as to the custom of burying
the dead in these enclosures.</p>

<p>Thus Captain Cook writes: "I must more explicitly
observe that there are two places in which the dead are
deposited: one a kind of shed, where the flesh is suffered to
putrefy; the other an enclosure, with erections of stones,
where the bones are afterwards buried. The sheds are called
<i>tupapow</i>, and the enclosures <i>morai</i>. The <i>morais</i> are also
places of worship".<a name="FNanchor_115_732" id="FNanchor_115_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_732" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Again, after describing how a dead
body used to be placed in the temporary house or shed
(<i>tupapow</i>) and left there to decay for five moons, Captain
Cook tells us that "what remains of the body is taken down
from the bier, and the bones, having been scraped and
washed very clean, are buried, according to the rank of
the person, either within or without a <i>morai</i>: if the deceased
was an <i>earee</i> or chief, his skull is not buried with the rest
of the bones, but is wrapped up in fine cloth, and put in
a kind of box made for that purpose, which is also placed
in the <i>morai</i>. This coffer is called <i>ewharre no te orometua</i>,
the house of a teacher or master".<a name="FNanchor_116_733" id="FNanchor_116_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_733" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Again, after describing the human sacrifice which he
witnessed at the great <i>morai</i> at Attahooroo, in Tahiti,
Captain Cook proceeds as follows: "The <i>morai</i> (which,
undoubtedly, is a place of worship, sacrifice, and burial
at the same time), where the sacrifice was now offered, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
that where the supreme chief of the whole island is always
buried, and is appropriated to his family, and some of the
principal people. It differs little from the common ones,
except in extent. Its principal part is a large oblong pile
of stones, lying loosely upon each other, about twelve or
fourteen feet high, contracted toward the top, with a square
area on each side, loosely paved with pebble stones, under
which the bones of the chiefs are buried.... The human
sacrifices are buried under different parts of the pavement."<a name="FNanchor_117_734" id="FNanchor_117_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_734" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Again, Captain Cook tells us that after a battle the
victors used to collect all the dead that had fallen into their
hands and bring them to the <i>morai</i>, where, with much
ceremony, they dug a hole and buried all the bodies in it
as so many offerings to the gods; but the skulls of the slain
were never afterwards taken up. Their own great chiefs who
fell in battle were treated in a different manner. Captain
Cook was informed that the bodies of the late king and two
chiefs, who were slain in battle, were brought to the <i>morai</i>
at Attahooroo. There the priests cut out the bowels of the
corpses before the great altar, and the bodies were afterwards
buried at three different spots in the great pile of stones
which formed the most conspicuous feature of the <i>morai</i>.
Common men who perished in the same battle were all
buried in a single hole at the foot of the pile. The spots
where the bodies of the king and chiefs reposed were pointed
out to Captain Cook and his companions.<a name="FNanchor_118_735" id="FNanchor_118_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_735" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Again, in the island of Tahiti, the naturalist George
Forster, who accompanied Captain Cook, saw a stone
building, "in form of the frustum of a pyramid," constructed
in terraces or steps, and measuring about twenty
yards in length at the base. "This the native said was a
burying-place and place of worship, <i>mar&agrave;i</i>, and distinguished
it by the name of <i>marai no-Aheatua</i>, the burying-place of
Aheatua, the present king of Tiarroboo."<a name="FNanchor_119_736" id="FNanchor_119_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_736" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Again, in the island of Huahine, the missionaries Tyerman
and Bennet saw "a pagan <i>marae</i> hard by, where the
sovereigns of Huahine were buried&mdash;and where, indeed,
they lay in more than oriental state, each one resting in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
his bed, at the foot of the Sacred Mountain, beneath the
umbrage of the magnificent <i>aoa</i> [tree], and near the beach
for ever washed by waters that roll round the world....
The great <i>marae</i> itself was dedicated to Tani, the father of
the gods here; but the whole ground adjacent was marked
with the vestiges of smaller <i>maraes</i>&mdash;private places for
worship and family interment&mdash;while this was the capital
of the island and the headquarters of royalty and idolatry."<a name="FNanchor_120_737" id="FNanchor_120_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_737" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
A little later, speaking of the same sacred place, the
missionaries observe, "The first <i>marae</i> that we visited was
the sepulchral one of the kings of Huahine, for many
generations. It was an oblong inclosure, forty-five feet
long by twenty broad, fenced with a strong stone wall.
Here the bodies of the deceased, according to the manner
of the country, being bound up, with the arms doubled to
their shoulders, the legs bent under their thighs and both
forced upwards against the abdomen, were let down, without
coffins, into a hole prepared for their reception, and just deep
enough to allow the earth to cover their heads."<a name="FNanchor_121_738" id="FNanchor_121_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_738" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>One of our best authorities on these islands, William
Ellis, speaks of the <i>maraes</i> (<i>morais</i>), whether they belonged
to private families, to districts, or to the kings, as being
"the general depositories of the bones of the departed,
whose bodies had been embalmed"; and as a motive for
the practice he alleges the sanctity which attached to these
places, and which might naturally be supposed to guard the
graves against impious and malicious violation.<a name="FNanchor_122_739" id="FNanchor_122_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_739" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> However,
the first missionaries say of the islanders that "they bury
none in the <i>morai</i>, but those offered in sacrifice, or slain in
battle, or the children of chiefs which have been strangled at
the birth&mdash;an act of atrocious inhumanity too common."<a name="FNanchor_123_740" id="FNanchor_123_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_740" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
According to Moerenhout, the <i>marais</i> (<i>morais</i>) belonging to
private families were often used as cemeteries; but in the
public <i>marais</i> none but the human victims, and sometimes
the priests, were interred.<a name="FNanchor_124_741" id="FNanchor_124_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_741" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Thus there is to some extent
a conflict of testimony between our authorities on the subject
of burial in the temples. But the evidence which I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
adduced seems to render it probable that many at least of
the <i>morais</i> served as burial-grounds for kings and chiefs of
high degree, and even for common men who had fallen
fighting in the service of their country.</p>

<p>In more recent years the German traveller, Arthur
Baessler, who examined and described the existing ruins
of these sacred edifices, denied that the <i>maraes</i> (<i>morais</i>) were
places of burial, while he allowed that they were places of
worship.<a name="FNanchor_125_742" id="FNanchor_125_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_742" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> He distinguished a <i>marae</i> from an <i>ahu</i>, admitting
at the same time that they closely resembled each other,
both in their structure and in the ritual celebrated at them.<a name="FNanchor_126_743" id="FNanchor_126_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_743" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
According to him, a <i>marae</i> was a sort of domestic chapel,
the possession of which constituted the most distinctive mark
of a noble family. Every chief, high or low, had one of
them and took rank according to its antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_127_744" id="FNanchor_127_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_744" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> It was an
oblong area, open to the sky and enclosed by walls on three
sides and by a pyramid on the fourth: walls and pyramid
alike were built of blocks of stone or coral.<a name="FNanchor_128_745" id="FNanchor_128_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_745" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The <i>ahu</i>, on
the other hand, was a monument erected to the memory of
a distinguished chief, whose mortal remains were deposited
in it. But apart from the grave which it contained, the <i>ahu</i>,
according to Baessler, hardly differed from a <i>marae</i>, though
it was mostly larger: it was a great walled enclosure with
a pyramid, altars, and houses of the priests. And the ritual
celebrated in the <i>ahu</i> resembled the ritual performed in the
<i>marae</i>: there, too, the faithful assembled to pray, and there
the priests recited the same liturgy.<a name="FNanchor_129_746" id="FNanchor_129_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_746" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Thus both the form
and, to some extent at least, the function of the two types
of sanctuary presented a close similarity. The islanders
themselves, it appears, do not always clearly distinguish them
at the present day.<a name="FNanchor_130_747" id="FNanchor_130_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_747" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> And the single distinction on which
Baessler insisted, that the dead were buried in the <i>ahu</i> but
not in the <i>marae</i>, seems not to hold good universally, even
on Baessler's own showing. For he admits that, "if ever
a chief was buried in his own <i>marae</i>, it must have been in
most exceptional cases, but probably statements to that
effect rest only on a confusion of the <i>marae</i> with the <i>ahu</i>;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
such a practice would also run counter to the habits of the
natives, who sought the most secret places for their dead,
and certainly concealed the heads in caves difficult of access
and unknown to others. On the other hand, the <i>maraes</i> of
humbler families may more frequently, if not as a rule, have
served as places of burial."<a name="FNanchor_131_748" id="FNanchor_131_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_748" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> And even in regard to the
holiest <i>marae</i>, dedicated to the great god Oro, in the island
of Raiatea,<a name="FNanchor_132_749" id="FNanchor_132_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_749" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Baessler himself cites a tradition, apparently well
authenticated, that a great number of warriors slain in battle
were buried in it.<a name="FNanchor_133_750" id="FNanchor_133_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_750" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The argument that the people buried
their dead, or at all events their skulls, only in remote caves
among the mountains seems untenable; for according to the
evidence of earlier writers the practice of concealing the
bones or the skulls of the dead in caves was generally, if not
always, a precaution adopted in time of war, to prevent these
sacred relics from falling into the hands of invaders; the
regular custom seems to have been to bury the bones in or
near the <i>marae</i> and to keep the skulls either there or in the
house.<a name="FNanchor_134_751" id="FNanchor_134_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_751" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> On the whole, then, it is perhaps safer to follow
earlier and, from the nature of the case, better-informed
writers in neglecting the distinction which Baessler drew
between a <i>marae</i> (<i>morai</i>) and an <i>ahu</i>. In any case we
have Baessler's testimony that an <i>ahu</i> was at once a place
of burial and a place of worship. There seems to be no
evidence that any of these sacred edifices, whether <i>maraes</i>
or <i>ahus</i>, were associated with a worship of the sun. On the
other hand, it is certain that some at least of them were
dedicated, partly or chiefly, to a cult of the dead, which
formed a very important element in the religion of the
Society Islanders, whereas there is little or nothing to show
that they adored either the sun, or any other of the heavenly
bodies, with the possible exception of the moon.<a name="FNanchor_135_752" id="FNanchor_135_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_752" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> This did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
not, however, prevent them from entertaining absurd notions
concerning these great luminaries. At an eclipse they
imagined that the moon or the sun was being swallowed
by some god whom they had offended; and on such
occasions they repaired to the temple and offered prayers
and liberal presents to the deity for the purpose of inducing
him to disgorge the luminary.<a name="FNanchor_136_753" id="FNanchor_136_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_753" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Temples such as have been described were erected on all
important occasions, such as a war, a decisive victory, or the
installation of a great chief or king of a whole island. In
these latter cases the natives boasted that the number of
persons present was so great that, if each of them only
brought a single stone, the amount of stones thus collected
would have sufficed to build their largest temples and
pyramids.<a name="FNanchor_137_754" id="FNanchor_137_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_754" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> One of the occasions when it became necessary
to build new temples was when the old ones had been overthrown
by enemies in war. After such a desecration it was
customary to perform a ceremony for the purpose of purifying
the land from the defilement which it had incurred through
the devastations of the foe, who had, perhaps, demolished
the temples, destroyed or mutilated the idols, and burned
with fire the curiously carved pieces of wood which marked
the sacred places of interment and represented the spirits of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the dead (<i>tiis</i>). Before the rite of purification was performed
the temples were rebuilt, new altars reared, new images
placed within the sacred precincts, and new wooden effigies
set up near the graves. At the close of the rites in the new
temples, the worshippers repaired to the seashore, where the
chief priest offered a short prayer and the people dragged
a net of coco-nut leaves through a shallow part of the sea,
usually detaching small pieces of coral, which they brought
ashore. These were called fish and were delivered to the
priest, who conveyed them to the temple and deposited them
on the altar, offering at the same time a prayer to induce
the gods to cleanse the land from pollution, that it might be
as pure as the coral fresh from the sea. It was now thought
safe to abide on the soil and to eat of its produce, whereas
if the ceremony had not been performed, death would have
been, in the opinion of the people, the consequence of
partaking of fruits grown on the defiled land.<a name="FNanchor_138_755" id="FNanchor_138_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_755" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The temples were sacred. When a man approached one
of them to worship or to bring his offering to the altar, he
bared his body to the waist in sign of reverence and humility.<a name="FNanchor_139_756" id="FNanchor_139_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_756" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Women in general might not enter a temple, but when their
presence was indispensable for certain ceremonies, the ground
was covered with cloth, on which they walked, lest they should
defile the holy place with their feet.<a name="FNanchor_140_757" id="FNanchor_140_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_757" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> For example, some
six weeks or two months after the birth of a child the father
and mother took the child to a temple, where they both
offered their blood to the gods by cutting their heads with
shark's teeth and allowing the blood to drip on leaves, which
they laid on the altar. On this occasion the husband spread
a cloth on the floor of the temple for his wife to tread upon,
for she might not step on the ground or the pavement.<a name="FNanchor_141_758" id="FNanchor_141_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_758" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Similarly at marriage bride and bridegroom visited the family
temple (<i>marae</i>, <i>morai</i>), where the skulls of their ancestors
were brought out and placed before them; but a large white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
cloth had to be spread out on the pavement for the bride to
walk upon. Sometimes at these marriage rites the female
relatives cut their faces and brows with shark's teeth, caught
the flowing blood on cloth, and deposited the cloth, sprinkled
with the mingled blood of the mothers of the married pair, at
the feet of the bride.<a name="FNanchor_142_759" id="FNanchor_142_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_759" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> At other times the mother of the bride
gashed her own person cruelly with a shark's tooth, and having
filled a coco-nut basin with the blood which flowed from her
wounds, she presented it to the bridegroom, who immediately
threw it from him.<a name="FNanchor_143_760" id="FNanchor_143_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_760" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> While certain festivals were being celebrated
at the temples the exclusion of women from them
was still more rigid. Thus in the island of Huahine, during
the celebration of the great annual festival, at which all the
idols of the island were brought from their various shrines to
the principal temple to be clothed with new dresses and
ornaments, no woman was allowed to approach any of the
sacred edifices under pain of death, which was instantly
inflicted by whoever witnessed the sacrilege. Even if the
wives and children of the priests themselves came within a
certain distance, while some particular services were going
on, they were murdered on the spot by their husbands and
fathers with the utmost ferocity.<a name="FNanchor_144_761" id="FNanchor_144_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_761" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Some of these sacred edifices are still impressive in their
ruins and deserve the name of megalithic monuments. Thus
the temple (<i>marae</i>, <i>morai</i>) of Oro at Opoa, which was the
holiest temple in the island of Raiatea and perhaps in the
Society Islands generally,<a name="FNanchor_145_762" id="FNanchor_145_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_762" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> is about a hundred and thirty-eight
feet long by twenty-six feet broad. It is enclosed by a
wall of gigantic coral blocks standing side by side to a height
of about six feet seven inches. The blocks have been hewn
from the inner reef; the outer surfaces were smoothed, the
inner left rough. One of the blocks stands over eleven feet
high, without reckoning the part concealed by the soil; it
is twelve feet wide, by two and a half feet thick. Another
block is about ten feet long by eight feet broad and one foot
thick.<a name="FNanchor_146_763" id="FNanchor_146_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_763" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> In the ruined temple of Tainuu, situated in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
district of Tevaitoa, one block is about eleven and a half feet
high by eleven feet wide, with a thickness varying from
twenty inches to two and a half feet.<a name="FNanchor_147_764" id="FNanchor_147_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_764" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The idols or images of the gods were usually made of
wood, but sometimes of stone. Some were rudely carved in
human shape; others were rough unpolished logs, wrapped
in many folds of cloth or covered with a matting of coco-nut
fibre.<a name="FNanchor_148_765" id="FNanchor_148_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_765" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The image of the god Oro was a straight log of
casuarina wood, six feet long, uncarved, but decorated with
feathers. On the other hand Taaroa, the supreme deity of
Polynesia, was represented by a rudely carved human figure
about four feet high, with a number of little images studding
his body to indicate the multitude of gods that had proceeded
from him as creator. The body of the god was hollow, and
when it was taken from the temple, where it had been
worshipped for many generations, it was found to contain a
number of small idols in the cavity. It is supposed that
these petty gods had been placed there by their worshippers
and owners that they might absorb some of the supernatural
powers of the greater divinity before being removed to the
places where they were to commence deities on their own
account.<a name="FNanchor_149_766" id="FNanchor_149_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_766" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> With a similar intention it was customary to fill
the inside of the hollow images with red feathers in order
that the plumes might be impregnated with the divine influence
and might afterwards diffuse it for the benefit of the
owner of the feathers, who had placed them in the image
for that purpose. The red feathers, plucked from a small
bird which is found in many of the islands, thus became an
ordinary medium for communicating and extending supernatural
powers, not only in the Society Islands, but throughout
Polynesia. The beautiful long tail-feathers of the tropic
or man-of-war bird were used for the same purpose. The
gods were supposed to be very fond of these feathers and
ready to impart their blessed essence to them. Hence people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
brought the feathers to the priest and received from him in
exchange two or three which had been sanctified in the
stomach of the deity; on extracting them from that receptacle,
the priest prayed to the god that he would continue to
inhabit the red feathers even when they were detached from
his divine person.<a name="FNanchor_150_767" id="FNanchor_150_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_767" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The feathers thus consecrated were themselves
regarded as in some sense divine and were called gods
(<i>atuas</i>, <i>oromatuas</i>); the people had great confidence in their
sovereign virtue, and on occasions of danger they sought
them out, believing that the mere presence of the feathers
would afford them adequate protection. For example, when
they were threatened by a storm at sea, they would hold out
the feathers to the menacing clouds and command them to
depart.<a name="FNanchor_151_768" id="FNanchor_151_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_768" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 5. <i>The Sacrifices, Priests, and Sacred Recorders</i></h4>

<p>The offerings presented to the gods included every kind
of valuable property, such as birds, fish, beasts, the fruits of
the earth and the choicest native manufactures. The fruits
and other eatables were generally, but not always, dressed.
Portions of the fowls, pigs, or fish, cooked with sacred fire in
the temple, were presented to the deity; the remainder
furnished a banquet for the priests and other sacred persons,
who were privileged to eat of the sacrifices. The portions
appropriated to the gods were placed on the altar and left
there till they decayed. In the public temples the great
altars were wooden stages, some eight or ten feet high, supported
on a number of wooden posts, which were sometimes
curiously carved and polished. But there were also smaller
altars in the temples; some of them were like round tables,
resting on a single post. Domestic altars and such as were
erected near the bodies of dead friends were small square
structures of wicker-work. In sacrificing pigs they were
very anxious not to break a bone or disfigure the animal.
Hence they used to strangle the animal or bleed it to death.<a name="FNanchor_152_769" id="FNanchor_152_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_769" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Human victims were sacrificed on many occasions, as in
time of war, at great national festivals, during the illness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
their rulers, and at the building of a temple. William Ellis
was told that the foundations of some of their sacred edifices
were laid in human sacrifices, and that at least the central
pillar, which supported the roof of one of the sacred houses
at Maeva, had been planted on the body of a man. The
victims were either captives taken in war or persons who had
rendered themselves obnoxious to the chiefs or the priests.
In the technical language of the priests they were called "fish."
When once a man had been chosen for sacrifice, the family
to which he belonged was regarded as taboo or devoted to
the altar, and when another victim was wanted, he was more
frequently taken from that family than from any other.
Similarly, a district which had once furnished victims was
thenceforth devoted. Hence, at the approach of ceremonies
which were usually accompanied by human sacrifices, the
members of certain families and the inhabitants of certain
districts used to flee to the mountains and hide in
caves till the ceremony was over. But the doomed man
was seldom apprised of his fate beforehand. A sudden
blow with a club or a stone on the nape of the neck was
the usual way of despatching him, lest the body should be
mangled or a bone broken. If the blow had only stunned
him, he was soon killed, and the corpse, placed in a long
basket of coco-nut leaves, was carried to the temple and
offered to the god by being set before the idol. In dedicating
it the priest took out one of the eyes and handed it on
a leaf to the king, who made as if he would swallow it, but
passed it on to a priest or attendant. After the ceremony
the body, still wrapt in coco-nut leaves, was often deposited
on the branches of a neighbouring tree, where it remained
some time. Finally, the bones were taken down and buried
under the pavement of the temple (<i>marae</i>).<a name="FNanchor_153_770" id="FNanchor_153_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_770" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>In the family, according to patriarchal usage, the father
was the priest, but the priests of the national temples formed
a distinct class; their office was hereditary. The high priesthood
was often held by a member of the royal family, and
sometimes the king himself acted as the national priest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
The duties of the priests were to recite prayers, to present
offerings, and to sacrifice victims.  Their prayers, usually
uttered in shrill, chanting tones, were often exceedingly long
and full of repetitions.<a name="FNanchor_154_771" id="FNanchor_154_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_771" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> They had plenty of employment,
being called in to officiate on all occasions, whether at birth
or at death, at feasts or in sickness; for they were the
physicians as well as the clergy of the country. They
professed to possess extraordinary powers, such as to promote
conception or to effect abortion, to cause or to heal
disease, to pray the evil spirit into food, and even to kill
men outright. Hence they were greatly feared.<a name="FNanchor_155_772" id="FNanchor_155_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_772" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Of
the little knowledge that existed in the islands the priests
are reported to have possessed the largest share, but it
consisted chiefly in an acquaintance with the names and
ranks of the various subordinate deities (<i>atuas</i>); however,
according to Captain Cook, they excelled the rest of
the people in their knowledge of navigation and astronomy:
indeed, the very name for priest (<i>tahowa</i>) signified nothing
more than a man of knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_156_773" id="FNanchor_156_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_773" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> In the island of Huahine the
priest whose duty it was to carry the image of the god Tani
(Tane) "was a personage of such superhuman sanctity that
everything which he touched became sacred; he was, therefore,
not suffered to marry, as the honour of being his wife
was too much for any mortal woman. But this was not all;
he would himself be so defiled by such a connection that he
would be disqualified for his office, and must immediately
resign it; nay, if he did not repent, and return with a great
peace-offering to Tani's house, he might expect to be first
struck blind, and afterwards strangled in his sleep. He was
not allowed to climb a cocoa tree, because, if he did, it would
be so hallowed that nobody else durst afterwards ascend it."<a name="FNanchor_157_774" id="FNanchor_157_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_774" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>One of the most important functions of the priests was
to act as mouthpieces of the gods. In the discharge of this
duty they were believed to be inspired and possessed by the
deity, who spoke through them to the people. When the
time came for them to consult the god, they assumed an odd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
fantastic dress, enriched with red and black feathers, to which
the deity was so partial, that when the priests approached
him in this array, he descended to earth at their call in one
of the sacred birds that frequented the temples (<i>morais</i>) and
fed on the sacrifices. As soon as the bird lighted on the
sacred edifice, the god left the fowl and entered into the
priest. The holy man, thus inspired, now stretched himself,
yawned, and rubbed his arms, legs, and body, which began
to be inflated, as if the skin of the abdomen would burst;
the eyes of the seer were thrown into various contortions,
now staring wide, now half-shut and sinking into stupor, while
at other times the whole frame was convulsed and appeared
to have undergone a sudden and surprising change. The
voice sank to a low pitch, and grew squeaky and broken;
but at times it would suddenly rise to an astonishing height.
The words uttered by the possessed man were regarded as
oracular, and nothing that he asked for the god or for himself
in this state was ever refused him. Of all this the priest
himself affected to be entirely unaware, but a colleague was
regularly at hand to record the divine message and the divine
requirements, which were often very large. When the deity
took his departure from the priest, he did so with such convulsions
and violence as to leave the man lying motionless
and exhausted on the ground, and the oracle was so timed
that this happened at the very moment when the sacred bird,
the vehicle of the god, flew away from the temple. On
coming to himself the priest uttered a loud shriek and seemed
to wake as from a profound sleep, unconscious of everything
that had passed.<a name="FNanchor_158_775" id="FNanchor_158_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_775" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Sometimes, however, the priest continued
to be possessed by the deity for two or three days; at such
times he wore a piece of native cloth, of a peculiar sort,
round one arm as a sign of his inspiration. His acts during
this period were deemed to be those of the god; hence the
greatest attention was paid to his expressions and to the
whole of his deportment. Indeed, so long as the fit of
inspiration lasted he was called a god (<i>atua</i>); but when it
was over, he resumed his ordinary title of priest.<a name="FNanchor_159_776" id="FNanchor_159_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_776" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>We are told that in his fine frenzy the priest "often rolled
on the earth, foaming at the mouth, as if labouring under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the influence of the divinity, by whom he was possessed, and,
in shrill cries, and violent and often indistinct sounds, revealed
the will of the god."<a name="FNanchor_160_777" id="FNanchor_160_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_777" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> It would probably be a mistake to
assume that on such occasions the frantic behaviour was
deliberately assumed and the wild whirling words were
consciously uttered for the purpose of deceiving the people;
in short, that the whole performance was a mere piece of
acting, a bare-faced imposture. It is far more likely that,
bred from childhood to believe in the reality of divine inspiration,
the priest often sincerely imagined himself to be possessed
by a deity, and that, under the excitement which such
an imagination was calculated to produce, he honestly mistook
his own thick-coming fancies for a revelation from the gods.
A chief, who had formerly been a prophet of the god Oro,
assured the missionaries "that although he sometimes feigned
his fits of inspiration, to deceive the credulous multitude, yet,
at other times, they came upon him involuntarily and irresistibly.
Something seemed to rush through his whole frame,
and overpower his spirit, in a manner which he could not
describe. Then he frothed at the mouth, gnashed his teeth,
and distorted his limbs with such violence that it required
five or six strong men to hold him. At these times his
words were deemed oracles, and whatever he advised respecting
state affairs, or other matters, was implicitly observed by
king and chiefs."<a name="FNanchor_161_778" id="FNanchor_161_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_778" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Thus on the ravings of these crazy
fanatics or deliberate impostors often hung the issues of life
or death, of war or peace.<a name="FNanchor_162_779" id="FNanchor_162_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_779" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> It appears to have been especially
the priests of Oro who laid claim to inspiration and contrived
to shape the destinies of their country through the powerful
sway which they exercised over the mind of the king. In
their fits of fanatical frenzy, while they delivered their oracles,
they insisted on the sovereign's implicit compliance with their
mandates, denouncing the most dreadful judgments on him
if he should prove refractory.<a name="FNanchor_163_780" id="FNanchor_163_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_780" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Apart from the priests there was a class of men whose
business it was to preserve and hand down to their successors
the lists of the gods, the liturgical prayers, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
sacred traditions. As these liturgies and legends were often
very lengthy and couched in a metaphorical and obscure
language, a prodigious memory and long practice were
indispensable for their preservation and transmission among a
people to whom the art of writing was unknown. Since the
slightest mistake in the recitation of a liturgy was deemed
the worst of omens and necessitated the suspension of the
religious service, however costly and important the service
might be, the sacred recorders, as we may call them, were
obliged, for the sake of their credit, to practise continually
the recitation of the prayers, legends, and traditions of which
they were the depositories. To aid them in their task they
made use of bundles of little sticks of different sizes, one of
which they drew from a bundle at the conclusion of each
prayer. It was their duty on solemn occasions to recite
these liturgies or sacred poems while they paced slowly
by night round the temples (<i>morais</i>) and other holy places;
hence they went by the name of <i>harepo</i>, which means
"Walkers by night." We are told that if at these times they
made a mistake in a single word or hesitated for a moment,
they stopped and returned home; and if the subject of their
prayers chanced to be some enterprise in which they desired
to enlist the favour of the gods, such a mistake or hesitation
was enough to cause the undertaking to be abandoned
irretrievably, since success in it was believed to be impossible.
Nothing, it is said, could be more astonishing than the
memory displayed by these men, while they recited, word
for word, and for nights together, the ancient traditions of
which the mutilated and mangled remains would demand
the assiduous study of several years. The office of sacred
recorder (<i>harepo</i>) was hereditary in the male line; the sons
were trained in the duties from their earliest years, but only
such as were endowed with an excellent memory could
satisfy the requirements of the profession. They believed
that a good memory was a gift of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_164_781" id="FNanchor_164_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_781" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<h4>&sect; 6. <i>The Doctrine of the Human Soul</i></h4>

<p>Of the Society Islanders we are informed that "they
believe every man to have a separate being within him,
named <i>tee</i>, which acts in consequence of the impression of
the senses, and combines ideas into thoughts. This being,
which we would call the soul, exists after death, and lodges
in the wooden images which are placed round the burying-places,
and which are called by the same name, <i>tee</i>."<a name="FNanchor_165_782" id="FNanchor_165_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_782" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> When
they were asked in what part of the body the soul resides,
they always answered that it was seated in the belly or in
the bowels (<i>I roto t&eacute; obou</i>). They would not admit that the
brain could be the seat of thought or the heart of the
affections; and in support of their opinion they alleged the
agitation of the bowels in strong emotion, such as fear and
desire.<a name="FNanchor_166_783" id="FNanchor_166_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_783" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Hence, too, they called thoughts by a phrase which
signifies "words in the belly" (<i>parou no te oboo</i>).<a name="FNanchor_167_784" id="FNanchor_167_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_784" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>But the Society Islanders did not regard the possession
of a soul as a privilege peculiar to humanity. According
to Captain Cook, "they maintain that not only all other
animals, but trees, fruit, and even stones, have souls, which
at death, or upon being consumed or broken, ascend to
the divinity, with whom they first mix, and afterwards pass
into the mansion allotted to each."<a name="FNanchor_168_785" id="FNanchor_168_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_785" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Their word for soul
was <i>varoua</i>, according to Moerenhout, who adds that, "It
appears that they accorded this <i>varoua</i> (spirit, soul) not
only to man, but even in addition to the animals, to plants,
to everything that vegetates, grows or moves on the earth."<a name="FNanchor_169_786" id="FNanchor_169_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_786" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>They thought that the soul of man could be separated
for a time from the body during life without causing
immediate death. Thus, like many other peoples, they
explained dreams by the supposed absence of the soul
during slumber. We are told that "they put great confidence
in dreams, and suppose in sleep the soul leaves
the body under the care of the guardian angel, and moves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
at large through the regions of spirits. Thus they say,
My soul was such a night in such a place, and saw such
a spirit. When a person dies, they say his soul is fled
away, <i>h&#257;rre p&#333;</i>, gone to night."<a name="FNanchor_170_787" id="FNanchor_170_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_787" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> But they also believed
that a man's soul or spirit could be conjured out of his
body by magic art or demoniacal agency. Thus, when
people had been robbed, they would sometimes call in
the help of a priest to ascertain the thief. In such a case
the priest, after offering prayers to his demon, would direct
them to dig a hole in the floor of the house and to fill
it with water; then, taking a young plantain in his hand,
he would stand over the hole and pray to the god, whom
he invoked, and who, if he were propitious, was supposed
to conduct the spirit of the thief to the house and to place
it over the water. The image of the spirit, which they
believed to resemble the person of the man, was, according
to their account, reflected in the water and perceived by
the priest, who was thus able to identify the thief, alleging
that the god had shown him the reflection of the culprit in
the water.<a name="FNanchor_171_788" id="FNanchor_171_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_788" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> From this it appears that in the opinion of
the Society Islanders, as of many other peoples, a man's
soul or spirit is a faithful image of his body.<a name="FNanchor_172_789" id="FNanchor_172_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_789" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>They believed that in the pangs of death the soul keeps
fluttering about the lips, and that, when all is over, it ascends
and mixes with or, as they expressed it, is eaten by the
deity.<a name="FNanchor_173_790" id="FNanchor_173_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_790" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> When one of their sacred recorders (<i>harepo</i>), who
had been famous in his life for his knowledge of the ancient
traditions, was at the point of death, it was customary for
his son and successor to place his mouth over the mouth of
the dying man, as if to inhale the parting soul at the moment
of quitting the body; for in this way he was supposed to
inherit the lore of his father. The natives, it is said, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
convinced that these sages owed their learning to this
expedient, though none the less they studied day and night
to perfect themselves in their profession.<a name="FNanchor_174_791" id="FNanchor_174_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_791" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 7. <i>Disease, Death, and Mourning</i></h4>

<p>Every disease was supposed to be the result of direct
supernatural agency, and to be inflicted by the gods for
some crime committed against the law of taboo of which the
sufferer had been guilty; or it might have been brought
upon him by an enemy, who had compassed his destruction
by means of an offering. They explained death in like
manner: according to them, it was invariably caused by
the direct influence of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_175_792" id="FNanchor_175_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_792" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> They acknowledged,
indeed, that they possessed poisons which, taken with food,
produced convulsions and death, but these effects they traced
to the anger of the gods, who employed the drugs as their
material agents or secondary causes. Even when a man
was killed in battle, they still saw in his death the hand
of a god, who had actually entered into the weapon that
inflicted the fatal blow.<a name="FNanchor_176_793" id="FNanchor_176_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_793" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The gods who were thus supposed to afflict human life
with sickness and disease and to bring it to an untimely
termination in death were not always nor perhaps usually
the high primaeval deities; often they were the souls of the
dead, who ranked among the domestic divinities (<i>oromatuas</i>).
And, like the Maoris,<a name="FNanchor_177_794" id="FNanchor_177_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_794" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> the natives of the Society Islands are
said to have stood in particular fear of the souls of dead
infants, who, angered at their mother for their too early death,
took their revenge by sending sickness on the surviving members
of the family. Hence when a woman was ill-treated by
her husband, she would often threaten to insult the ghost of a
dead baby; and this threat, with the deplorable consequences
which it was calculated to entail, seldom failed to bring the
husband to a better frame of mind; or if he happened to
prove recalcitrant, the other members of the family, who might
be involved in the calamity, would intercede and restore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
peace in the household. Thus we are told that among these
islanders the fear of the dead supplied in some measure
the place of natural affection and tenderness in softening
and humanising the general manners.<a name="FNanchor_178_795" id="FNanchor_178_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_795" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Disease and death were also attributed to the malignant
charms of sorcerers, who, hired by an enemy of the sufferer,
procured for the purpose the clipped hair or the spittle of
their intended victim, the flowers or garment he had worn,
or any object which had touched his person. But the real
agents who were thought to give effect to the charms were
the minor deities, whom the sorcerer employed to accomplish
his nefarious ends. For this purpose he put the hair or
other personal refuse of the victim in a bag along with the
images and symbols of the petty divinities, and buried the
bag and its contents in a hole which he had dug in the
ground. There he left it until, applying his ear to the hole,
he could hear the soul of the sufferer whimpering down
below, which proved that the charm was taking effect. If the
intended victim got wind of these machinations, it was always
in his power to render them abortive, either by sacrificing
to the gods or by sending a present to the sorcerer, who thus
was feed by both sides at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_179_796" id="FNanchor_179_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_796" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>However, most cases of sickness apparently were set
down not to the wiles of sorcerers, but to the displeasure
of the deified spirits of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_180_797" id="FNanchor_180_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_797" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> On this point the
evidence of the early missionaries is explicit. Speaking of
the Society Islanders, they say that "they regard the spirits
of their ancestors, male and female, as exalted into <i>eatooas</i>
[<i>atuas</i>, deities], and their favour to be secured by prayers
and offerings. Every sickness and untoward accident they
esteem as the hand of judgment for some offence committed;
and therefore, if they have injured any person,
they send their peace-offering, and make the matter up:
and if sick, send for the priest to offer up prayers and
sacrifices to pacify the offended <i>eatooa</i>; giving anything the
priests ask, as being very reluctant to die."<a name="FNanchor_181_798" id="FNanchor_181_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_798" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> "As it is their
fixed opinion, that no disease affects them but as a punishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
inflicted by their <i>eatooa</i> [<i>atua</i>] for some offence, and
never brought on themselves by intemperance or imprudence,
they trust more to the prayers of their priests than to any
medicine."<a name="FNanchor_182_799" id="FNanchor_182_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_799" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>They imagined that at death the soul (<i>varua</i>) was drawn
out of the head by a god or spirit (<i>atua</i>) as a sword is
drawn out of its scabbard, and that the spirits of the dead
often waited to catch it at the moment when it issued from
the body. Sometimes the dying man would fancy that he
saw the spirits lurking for him at the foot of the bed, and
would cry out in terror, "They are waiting for my spirit.
Guard it! Preserve it from them!"<a name="FNanchor_183_800" id="FNanchor_183_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_800" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>When the last struggle was over, a priest or diviner
(<i>tahua tutera</i>) was called in to ascertain the cause of death.
For this purpose he entered his canoe and paddled slowly
along on the sea, near the house in which the dead body
was lying, in order to watch the passage of the departing
spirit; for they thought that it would fly towards him with
the emblem of the cause through which the person had died.
If he had been cursed by the gods, the spirit would appear
with a flame, fire being the agent employed in the incantations
of the sorcerers, who had presumably drawn down the
curse upon the deceased. If some enemy had bribed the
gods to kill him, the spirit would come with a red feather,
as a sign that evil spirits had entered into his food. After
a short time the diviner returned to the house, announced
the cause of death to the survivors, and received his fee, the
amount of which was regulated by the circumstances of
the family. After that a priest was employed to perform
ceremonies and recite prayers for the purpose of averting
destruction from the surviving members of the family; but
the nature of the ceremonies has not been recorded.<a name="FNanchor_184_801" id="FNanchor_184_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_801" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>When it was manifest that death was approaching, the
relatives and friends, who had gathered round the sufferer,
broke into loud lamentations and other demonstrations of
sorrow, which redoubled in violence as soon as the spirit
had departed. Then they not only wailed in the loudest
and most affecting tone, but tore out their hair, rent their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
garments, and cut themselves with shark's teeth or knives in
a shocking manner. The instrument usually employed was
a small cane, about four inches long, with five or six teeth
fixed into it on opposite sides. Struck forcibly into the
head, these instruments wounded it like a lancet, so that the
blood poured down in copious streams. Every woman at
marriage provided herself with one of these implements and
used it unsparingly on herself on the occasion of a death in
the family. Some people, not content with this instrument
of torture, provided themselves with a sort of mallet armed
with two or three rows of shark's teeth; and with this
formidable weapon, on the demise of a relative or friend,
they hammered themselves unmercifully, striking their skulls,
temples, cheeks, and breast, till the blood flowed profusely
from the wounds. At the same time they uttered the most
deafening and agonising cries; and what with their frantic
gestures, the distortion of their countenances, their torn and
dishevelled hair, and the mingled tears and blood that
trickled down their bodies, they presented altogether a
horrible spectacle. This self-inflicted cruelty was practised
chiefly by women, but not by them alone; for the men on
these occasions committed the like enormities, and not only
cut themselves, but came armed with clubs and other deadly
weapons, which they sometimes plied freely on the bodies of
other people. These dismal scenes began with the nearest
relatives of the deceased, but they were not confined to them.
No sooner did the tidings spread, and the sound of wailing
was heard throughout the neighbourhood, than friends and
kinsfolk flocked to the spot and joined in the demonstrations
of real or affected sorrow. The pageant of woe reached its
climax when the deceased was a king or a principal chief.
It was then, above all, that the tenants and retainers came
armed with bludgeons and stones, with which they fought
each other till some of them were wounded or slain;
while others operated on themselves by tearing their
hair and lacerating their bodies in the usual manner till
their bodies were bedabbled with blood. After the introduction
of firearms into the islands, these lethal weapons
lent variety and noise to the combats, as well as adding
to the number of the slain. At the death of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
person of distinction these exhibitions of frenzied sorrow
sometimes lasted two or three days in succession, or even
longer.<a name="FNanchor_185_802" id="FNanchor_185_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_802" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> On such occasions a body of armed men, composed
of friends and allies, used to arrive from a neighbouring
district and request to be allowed access to the body of the
chief, in order that they might mourn for him in due form.
The request was always refused by the bodyguards, who
kept the last vigil over their departed lord; and in consequence
a fight ensued in which several warriors were
generally wounded or killed. Yet it was only a sham
fight, which seems to have always ended in a victory for
the mourners who had come from a distance; and when
it was over, victors and vanquished regularly united in
performing the usual sanguinary rites of mourning. In
all the islands wrestling matches, combats, and assaults-at-arms
were ordinary features of the obsequies of chiefs.<a name="FNanchor_186_803" id="FNanchor_186_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_803" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The blood which women in the paroxysms of grief
drew from their bodies, and the tears which flowed from
their eyes, were received on pieces of cloth, which were then
thrown upon or under the bier as oblations to the dead.<a name="FNanchor_187_804" id="FNanchor_187_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_804" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
Sometimes for this purpose a woman would wear a short
apron, which she held up with one hand, while she cut
herself with the other, till the apron was soaked in blood.
Afterwards she would dry it in the sun and present it to the
bereaved family, who kept it as a token of the estimation in
which the departed had been held.<a name="FNanchor_188_805" id="FNanchor_188_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_805" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Some of the younger
mourners used also to cut off their hair and throw it under
the bier with the other offerings.<a name="FNanchor_189_806" id="FNanchor_189_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_806" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> When the deceased was
a child, the parents, in addition to other tokens of grief,
used to cut their hair short on one part of their heads,
leaving the rest long; sometimes they shaved a square
patch on the forehead; sometimes they left the hair on the
forehead and cut off all the rest; at other times they removed
all the hair but a lock over one or both ears; or again
they would clip close one half of the head, while on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
other half the tresses were suffered to grow long; and these
signs of mourning might be continued for two or three
years.<a name="FNanchor_190_807" id="FNanchor_190_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_807" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Captain Cook tells us that the custom observed by
mourners of offering their own blood, tears, and hair to
their departed relative or friend "is founded upon a notion
that the soul of the deceased, which they believe to exist in
a separate state, is hovering about the place where the body
is deposited: that it observes the actions of the survivors,
and is gratified by such testimonies of their affection and
grief."<a name="FNanchor_191_808" id="FNanchor_191_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_808" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> This explanation, in perfect harmony with the
vigilance, vanity, and jealousy commonly ascribed to ghosts,
is in all probability correct. Yet it deserves to be noticed
that the custom of voluntarily hacking the body with shark's
teeth to the effusion of blood was singularly enough practised
by the Society Islanders on occasions of joy as well as of
sorrow. When a husband or a son returned to his family
after a season of absence or exposure to danger, his arrival
was greeted, not only with the cordial welcome and the
warm embrace, but with loud wailing, while the happy wife
or mother cut her body with shark's teeth, and the gladder
she was the more she gashed herself.<a name="FNanchor_192_809" id="FNanchor_192_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_809" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Similarly many
savage peoples weep over long-absent friends, or even over
strangers, as a polite form of greeting in which genuine
sorrow can hardly be supposed to play a part.<a name="FNanchor_193_810" id="FNanchor_193_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_810" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> It is
difficult to see how such observances can be based on
superstition; apparently the emotion of joy may express
itself in very different ways in different races.</p>

<p>The natives stood in great fear of the spirits of the dead,
which were supposed to haunt the places of their former
abode and to visit the habitations of men, but seldom on
errands of mercy or benevolence. They woke the survivors
from their slumbers by squeaking noises to upbraid them
with their past wickedness or to reproach them with the
neglect of some ceremony, for which the ghosts were compelled
to suffer. Thus the people imagined that they lived
in a world of spirits, which surrounded them night and day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
watching every action of their lives and ready to revenge the
smallest slight or the least disobedience to their injunctions,
as these were proclaimed to the living by the priests. Convulsions
and hysterics, for example, were ascribed to the
action of spirits, which seized the sufferer, scratched his face,
tore his hair, or otherwise maltreated him.<a name="FNanchor_194_811" id="FNanchor_194_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_811" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>This fear of the spirits of the dead induced the Society
Islanders to resort to some peculiar ceremonies for the
protection of the living against the ghosts of persons who
had recently died. One of these quaint rites was performed
by a priest, who went by the name of the
"corpse-praying priest" (<i>tahua bure tiapa-pau</i>). When
the corpse had been placed on a platform or bier in a
temporary house, this priest ordered a hole to be dug in
the earth or floor, near the foot of the platform, and over
this hole he prayed to the god by whom the spirit of
the deceased had been summoned to its long home. The
purport of the prayer was that all the dead man's sins, and
especially that for which his soul had been called to the
region of Night (<i>po</i>), should be deposited in that hole, that
they should not attach in any degree to the survivors, and
that the anger of the god might be appeased. The priest
next addressed the corpse, usually saying, "With you let the
guilt now remain." The pillar or post of the corpse, as it
was called, was then planted in the hole, earth was thrown
over the guilt of the departed, and the hole filled up. After
that, the priest proceeded to the side of the corpse, and
taking some small slips of plantain leaf-stalk he fixed two
or three of them under each arm, placed a few on the breast,
and then, addressing the dead body, said, "There are your
family, there is your child, there is your wife, there is your
father, and there is your mother. Be satisfied yonder (that
is, in the world of spirits). Look not towards those who are
left in this world." The concluding parts of the ceremony
were designed to impart contentment to the deceased, and
to prevent his spirit from repairing to the places of his
former resort, and so distressing the survivors. This was
considered a most important ceremony, being a kind of mass
for the dead and necessary as well for the peace of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
living as for the quiet of the departed. It was seldom
omitted by any who could pay the priest his usual fees,
which for this service generally took the form of pigs
and cloth, in proportion to the rank or possessions of the
family.<a name="FNanchor_195_812" id="FNanchor_195_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_812" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Soon after the decease of a chief or person of distinction,
another singular ceremony, called a <i>heva</i>, was performed by
the relatives or dependants, who personated the ghost of the
departed. The principal actor in the procession was a priest
or kinsman who wore a curious dress and an imposing head-ornament
called a <i>parae</i>. A cap or turban of thick native
cloth was fitted close to the head; in front were two broad
mother-of-pearl shells that covered the face like a mask, with
only a small aperture through which the wearer could look
in order to find his way. Above the mask were fixed a
number of long, white, red-tipped feathers of the tropic bird,
diverging like rays and forming a radiant circle; while
beneath the mask was a thin yet strong board curved like a
crescent, from which hung a sort of network of small pieces
of brilliant mother-of-pearl, finely polished and strung together
on threads. The depth of this network varied according
to the taste or means of the family, but it was generally
nine inches or a foot, and might consist of ten to fifteen or
twenty perfectly straight and parallel rows. The labour of
making this mother-of-pearl pendant must have been immense;
for many hundred pieces of the shell had to be cut,
ground down to the requisite thinness, polished and perforated,
without the use of iron tools, before a single line could
be fixed upon the head-dress. Fringed with feathers, the
pendant formed a kind of ornamental breastplate or stomacher.
Attached to it was a garment composed of alternate stripes
of black and yellow cloth, which enveloped the body and
reached sometimes to the loins, to the knees, or even to the
ankles.<a name="FNanchor_196_813" id="FNanchor_196_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_813" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> On his back the masker wore an ample cloak or
mantle of network covered with glossy pigeon's feathers of a
bluish colour. The costume appears to have been intended
as a disguise to prevent the spectators from recognising the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
wearer; for George Forster, who has given us an elaborate
description of it, observes that "an ample hood of alternate
parallel stripes of brown, yellow, and white cloth descends
from the turban to cover the neck and shoulders, in order
that as little as possible of the human figure may appear."<a name="FNanchor_197_814" id="FNanchor_197_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_814" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>In this strange garb the chief mummer, who was usually
the nearest relation of the deceased, carried in one hand a formidable
weapon, consisting of a staff about five feet long, one
end of which was rounded to serve as a handle, while the
other end broadened out into a sort of scythe, of which the
inner or concave side was armed with a row of large strong
shark's teeth fixed in the wood. In the other hand he bore
a kind of clapper formed of two pearl-oyster shells, beautifully
polished. Thus attired and equipped, he led a procession
either from the house of the deceased, or, according to
another account, from a valley to which, as if under a paroxysm
of grief, the party had retired at the death of the person for
whom the ceremony was performed; and as he walked along
he continued to rattle or jingle the shells against each other
to give notice of his approach. With him walked a number
of men and boys, naked except for a girdle, armed with
cudgels, their faces and bodies painted black, red, and white
with charcoal and coloured earths. In this impressive style
the mummers marched through the district, the people everywhere
fleeing in terror at the sight of them, and even deserting
the houses at their approach. For whenever the leader
caught sight of any one, he ran at him, and if he overtook
the fugitive, belaboured him with his sharp-toothed club, to
the grievous mauling of the unfortunate wretch; while, not
to be behind their leader, the assistants plied their bludgeons
on the bodies of all and sundry who chanced to fall into
their hands. At such times safety was only to be found in
the king's temple, which served on this as on other occasions
as a sort of sanctuary or place of refuge. Having thus scoured
the country, the mummers marched several times round the
platform where the body was exposed, after which they
bathed in a river and resumed their customary apparel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
This performance was repeated at intervals for five moons,
but less and less frequently as the end of the time approached.
The longer it lasted, the greater was the honour supposed to
be done to the dead. The relatives took it in turn to assume
the fantastic dress and discharge the office of leader. Throughout
the ceremonies the performers appeared and acted as if
they were deranged. They were supposed to be inspired by,
or at all events to represent, the spirit of the deceased, to
revenge any injury he might have received, or to punish
those who had not shown due respect to his remains.<a name="FNanchor_198_815" id="FNanchor_198_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_815" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Hence
we may infer that the whole of this quaint masquerade was
designed to appease the anger of the ghost, and so to protect
the survivors by preventing him from returning to take
vengeance on them for any wrongs or slights he might have
suffered at their hands.</p>

<p>The same fear of the returning ghost is clearly expressed
in a prayer which the natives used to address to a dead
relative at burial. They put blossoms of bread-fruit and
leaves of the edible fern under the arms of the corpse, and
as they did so, they prayed, saying, "You go to the Po
[Night, the World of Shades], plant bread-fruit there, and be
food for the gods; but do not come and strangle us, and we
will feed your swine and cultivate your lands."<a name="FNanchor_199_816" id="FNanchor_199_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_816" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 8. <i>The Disposal of the Dead</i></h4>

<p>The heat of the climate, by hastening the decomposition
of dead bodies, rendered it necessary that corpses should
be speedily removed or treated so as to preserve them
for a time from decay. As such treatment was generally
too costly for the poor and even the middle ranks of
society, families belonging to these classes were usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
obliged to inter their dead on the first or second day after
the decease. During the short intervening period the body,
resting on a bed of fragrant green leaves, was placed on a
sort of bier covered with white cloth and decorated with
wreaths and garlands of sweet-smelling flowers. Round it
sat the relatives, giving vent to their grief in loud and continued
lamentations, and often cutting their temples, faces,
and breasts with shark's teeth, till they were covered with
blood from their self-inflicted wounds. The bodies were
frequently committed to the grave in deep silence; but
sometimes a father would deliver a pathetic oration at the
funeral of his son.<a name="FNanchor_200_817" id="FNanchor_200_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_817" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> The grave was generally shallow and
the corpse was deposited in a bent posture, with the hands
tied to the knees or to the legs.<a name="FNanchor_201_818" id="FNanchor_201_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_818" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>But in the families of chiefs the custom was to submit
the bodies of the dead to a sort of embalming and to preserve
them above ground for a time.<a name="FNanchor_202_819" id="FNanchor_202_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_819" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The Tahitians had a
tradition of a rude or unpolished period in their history, when
the bodies of the dead were allowed to remain in the houses
in which they lived, and which were still occupied by the
survivors. A kind of stage or altar was erected in the dwelling,
and on it the corpse was deposited. But in a later and
more polished age, which lasted till the advent of Europeans,
the practice was introduced of building separate houses or
sheds for the lodgment of corpses.<a name="FNanchor_203_820" id="FNanchor_203_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_820" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>These houses or sheds (<i>tupapows</i>) were small temporary
buildings, often neatly constructed. The thatched roof rested
on wooden pillars, which were seldom more than six feet
high. The body was laid on a bier or platform raised on
posts about three feet from the ground. This bier was movable,
for the purpose of being drawn out, and of exposing the
body to the rays of the sun. The body was usually clothed
or covered with cloth, and for a long time it was carefully
rubbed with aromatic oils once a day. The size of these
charnel-houses varied with the rank of the persons whose
bodies they contained; the better sort were enclosed by railings.
Those which were allotted to people of the lower class
just sufficed to cover the bier, and were not railed in. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
largest seen by Captain Cook was eleven yards long. Such
houses were ornamented according to the taste and abilities
of the surviving kindred, who never failed to lay a profusion
of good cloth about the body, and sometimes almost covered
the outside of the house.<a name="FNanchor_204_821" id="FNanchor_204_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_821" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>But before the corpse was deposited in one of these
temporary structures, it was shrouded in cloth and carried
on a bier to the sea-shore, where it was set down on the
beach at the water's edge. There a priest, who accompanied
the procession, renewed the prayers which he had
offered over the body both at the house and on its passage
to the shore. Further, he took up water in his hands and
sprinkled it towards the corpse, but not upon it. These
prayers and sprinklings he repeated several times, and
between the repetitions the body was carried back some
forty or fifty yards from the sea, only to be brought back
again to the water's edge. While these ceremonies were
being performed, the temporary house or shed was being
prepared, in which the corpse was to remain until the flesh
had wholly wasted from the bones. Thither it was then
carried from the beach and laid upon the bier.<a name="FNanchor_205_822" id="FNanchor_205_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_822" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>The practice of embalming appears to have been long
familiar to the natives of the Society Islands. The methods
employed by them were simple. Sometimes the juices were
merely squeezed out of the corpse, which was then exposed
to the sun and anointed with fragrant oils. At other times,
and apparently more usually, the bowels, entrails, and brains
were extracted, and the cavities filled with cloth soaked in
perfumed oils, which were also injected into other parts of
the body. Scented oils were also rubbed over the outside
daily: every day the corpse was exposed to the sun in a
sitting posture: every night it was laid out horizontally and
often turned over, that it might not remain long on the same
side. By these means, combined with the heat of the sun
and the dryness of the atmosphere, the process of desiccation
was effected in the course of a few weeks: the muscular
parts and the eyes shrivelled up; and the wizened body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
resembled a skeleton covered with parchment or oilcloth.
Thus reduced to a mummy, it was clothed and fixed in a
sitting attitude: a small altar was erected before it; and
offerings of fruit, food, and flowers were daily presented by
the relatives or by the priest who was appointed to attend
to it. For if the deceased was a chief of high rank or
great renown, a priest or other person was set apart to wait
upon the corpse and to present food to its mouth at different
hours of the day. They supposed that the soul still hovered
over the mouldering remains and was pleased by such marks
of attention. Hence during the exposure of the body in the
temporary house the mourners would sometimes renew their
lamentations there, and, wounding themselves with shark's
teeth, wipe off the blood on a cloth, and deposit the bloody
rag beside the mummy as a proof of their affection. In this
state the desiccated body was preserved for many months
till the flesh had completely decayed; Ellis was of opinion
that the best-preserved of these mummies could not be kept
for more than twelve months. The bones were then scraped,
washed, and buried within the precincts of the family temple
(<i>morai</i>), if the deceased was a chief; but if he was a commoner,
they were interred outside of the holy ground. However,
the skull was not buried with the bones; it was carefully
wrapt in fine cloth and kept in a box by the family, it might
be for several generations. Sometimes the box containing
the skull was deposited at the temple, but often it was hung
from the roof of the house.<a name="FNanchor_206_823" id="FNanchor_206_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_823" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> At marriage the skulls of
ancestors were sometimes brought out and set before the
bride and bridegroom in order, apparently, to place the
newly wedded pair under the guardianship of the ancestral
spirits who had once animated these relics of mortality.<a name="FNanchor_207_824" id="FNanchor_207_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_824" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> In
time of war victorious enemies would sometimes despoil the
temples of the vanquished and carry off the bones of famous
men interred in them; these they would then subject to the
utmost indignity by converting them into chisels, borers, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
fish-hooks. To prevent this sacrilege the relations of the
dead conveyed the bones of their chiefs, and even the bodies
of persons who had lately died, to the mountains and hid
them in caverns among the most inaccessible rocks and lofty
precipices of these wild solitudes.<a name="FNanchor_208_825" id="FNanchor_208_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_825" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Where the mountains
advance to the coast, many of these caves exist in the face
of cliffs overhanging the sea; for the most part they are
situated in places which Europeans can reach only with the
help of ropes and ladders, though the natives, it is said, can
clamber up the steepest crags with ease. Few even of the
islanders know the situation of the caverns, and fewer still
will consent to act as guides to the curious stranger who may
wish to explore their recesses; for the fear of the ghosts, who
are supposed to haunt these ancient depositories of the dead,
is yet deeply rooted in the native mind. Moreover, the
mouths of the caves are generally so low and overgrown
with shrubs and creepers that they may easily be overlooked
by an observer standing in front of them. Some of the
grottos are said to be still full of skulls, or were so down to
the end of the nineteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_209_826" id="FNanchor_209_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_826" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The mummies as well
as the bones were liable to be captured by an invader, and
were esteemed trophies not less glorious than foemen slain
in battle. Hence during an invasion the mummies were
generally the first things to be carried off for safety to the
mountains.<a name="FNanchor_210_827" id="FNanchor_210_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_827" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>A dangerous pollution was supposed to be contracted by
all who had handled a corpse. Hence the persons employed
in embalming a body were carefully shunned by every one
else so long as the process lasted, because the guilt of the
crime for which the deceased had died was supposed to
attach in some degree to such as touched his mortal remains.
The embalmers did not feed themselves, lest the food, defiled
by the touch of their polluted hands, should cause their
death; so they were fed by others.<a name="FNanchor_211_828" id="FNanchor_211_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_828" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> This state of uncleanness
lasted for a month, during which the tabooed
persons were forbidden to handle food as well as to put it
into their own mouths.<a name="FNanchor_212_829" id="FNanchor_212_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_829" class="fnanchor">[212]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, when the ceremony of depositing the sins of the
deceased in a hole<a name="FNanchor_213_830" id="FNanchor_213_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_830" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> was over, all who had touched the body
or the garments of the deceased, which were buried or
destroyed, fled precipitately into the sea to cleanse themselves
from the pollution which they had incurred by contact
with the corpse; and they cast into the sea the garments
they had worn while they were engaged in the work.
Having bathed, they gathered a few pieces of coral from
the bottom of the sea, and returning with them to the
house, addressed the dead body, saying, "With you may
the pollution be." With these words they threw down the
pieces of coral on the top of the hole that had been dug to
receive all the objects defiled by their connexion with the
deceased.<a name="FNanchor_214_831" id="FNanchor_214_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_831" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>When a person had died of an infectious disorder, the
priests entreated him to bury the disease with him in the
grave and not to inflict it upon other people, when he
revisited them as a ghost. They also threw a plantain into
the grave, and either buried with him or burned all his
utensils, that nobody might be infected by them.<a name="FNanchor_215_832" id="FNanchor_215_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_832" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 9. <i>The Fate of the Soul after Death</i></h4>

<p>The natives of the Society Islands believed in the
immortality of the human soul, or at all events in its
separate existence after death<a name="FNanchor_216_833" id="FNanchor_216_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_833" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>; they thought that no
person perishes or becomes extinct.<a name="FNanchor_217_834" id="FNanchor_217_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_834" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> On its departure
from the body the spirit, now called a <i>tee</i>, <i>teehee</i>, or <i>tii</i>,
was supposed to linger near its old habitation, whether the
mouldering remains exposed on the bier, or the bones buried
in the earth, or the skull kept in its box. In this state the
spirits were believed to lodge in small wooden images,
seldom more than eighteen inches high, which were placed
round about the burial-ground.<a name="FNanchor_218_835" id="FNanchor_218_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_835" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> These images are variously
said to have borne the same name (<i>tee</i>, <i>teehee</i>) as the spirits
which inhabited them,<a name="FNanchor_219_836" id="FNanchor_219_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_836" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> or to have been called by a different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
name (<i>unus</i>)<a name="FNanchor_220_837" id="FNanchor_220_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_837" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. Specimens of these images were seen by
George Forster in Tahiti. He says that round about the
<i>marai</i> (<i>morai</i>) of Aheatua, at that time King of Tiarroboo,
"were placed perpendicularly, or nearly so, fifteen slender
pieces of wood, some about eighteen feet long, in which six
or eight diminutive human figures of a rude unnatural shape
were carved, standing above each other, male or female
promiscuously, yet so that the uppermost was always a male.
All these figures faced the sea, and perfectly resembled some
which are carved on the sterns of their canoes, and which
they call <i>e-tee</i>."<a name="FNanchor_221_838" id="FNanchor_221_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_838" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> To the same effect George Forster's father,
J. R. Forster, observes that "near the <i>marais</i> are twenty or
thirty single pieces of wood fixed into the ground, carved all
over on one side with figures about eighteen inches long,
rudely representing a man and a woman alternately, so that
often more than fifteen or twenty figures may be counted
on one piece of wood, called by them <i>Teehee</i>."<a name="FNanchor_222_839" id="FNanchor_222_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_839" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> But the
souls of the dead, though they inhabited chiefly the wooden
figures erected at the temples or burial-grounds (<i>marais</i>,
<i>morais</i>), were by no means confined to them, and were
dreaded by the natives, who believed that during the
night these unquiet spirits crept into people's houses and
ate the heart and entrails of the sleepers, thus causing
their death.<a name="FNanchor_223_840" id="FNanchor_223_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_840" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>However, the Society Islanders appear to have been
by no means consistent in the views which they held
concerning the fate of the soul after death. Like many
other people, they seem to have wavered between a belief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
that the souls of the dead lingered invisible near their
old homes and the belief that the disembodied spirits went
away to a distant land, where all human souls, which
have departed this life, met and dwelt together. Or perhaps
it might be more correct to say, that instead of wavering
between these two inconsistent beliefs, they held them both
firmly without perceiving their inconsistency. At all events
these islanders believed that either at death or at some
time after it their souls departed to a distant place called
<i>po</i> or Night, the common abode of gods and of departed
spirits.<a name="FNanchor_224_841" id="FNanchor_224_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_841" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Thither the soul was conducted by other spirits,
and on its arrival it was eaten by the gods, not all at once,
but by degrees. They imagined that the souls of ancestors
or relatives, who ranked among the gods, scraped the
different parts of the newly arrived spirit with a kind of
serrated shell at different times, after which they ate and
digested it. If the soul underwent this process of being
eaten and digested three separate times, it became a deified
or imperishable spirit and might visit the world and inspire
living folk.<a name="FNanchor_225_842" id="FNanchor_225_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_842" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> According to one account, the soul was cooked
whole in an earth-oven, as pigs are baked on earth, and was
then placed in a basket of coco-nut leaves before being
served up to the god whom the deceased had worshipped
in life. "By this cannibal divinity he was now eaten up;
after which, through some inexplicable process, the dead and
devoured man emanated from the body of the god, and became
immortal."<a name="FNanchor_226_843" id="FNanchor_226_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_843" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> In the island of Raiatea the great god Oro
was supposed to use a scallop-shell "to scrape the flesh
from the bones of newly deceased bodies, previous to their
being converted into pure spirits by being devoured by
him, and afterwards transformed by passing through the
laboratory of his cannibal stomach."<a name="FNanchor_227_844" id="FNanchor_227_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_844" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> This process of being
devoured by a god was not conceived of as a punishment
inflicted on wicked people after death; for good and bad
souls had alike to submit to it. Rather, Captain Cook tells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
us, the natives considered "this coalition with the deity as
a kind of purification necessary to be undergone before they
enter a state of bliss. For, according to their doctrine, if
a man refrain from all connexion with women some months
before death, he passes immediately into his eternal mansion,
without such a previous union; as if already, by this
abstinence, he were pure enough to be exempted from
the general lot."<a name="FNanchor_228_845" id="FNanchor_228_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_845" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> A slightly different account of this
process of spiritual purification is given by the first
missionaries to Tahiti. They say that "when the spirit
departs from the body, they have a notion it is swallowed
by the <i>eat&#333;oa</i> (<i>atua</i>) bird, who frequents their burying-places
and <i>morais</i>, and passes through him in order to
be purified, and be united to the deity. And such are
afterwards employed by him to attend other human beings
and to inflict punishment, or remove sickness, as shall be
deemed requisite."<a name="FNanchor_229_846" id="FNanchor_229_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_846" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the purification which the souls of the dead
underwent by passing through the body of a god or of a
divine bird, they were believed to be not wholly divested of
the passions which had actuated them in life on earth.
If the souls of former enemies met in the world beyond the
grave, they renewed their battles, but apparently to no
purpose, since they were accounted invulnerable in this
invisible state. Again, when the soul of a dead wife
arrived in the spirit land, it was known to the soul of
her dead husband, if he had gone before, and the two
renewed their acquaintance in a spacious house, called
<i>tourooa</i>, where the souls of the deceased assembled to
recreate themselves with the gods. After that the pair
retired to the separate abode of the husband, where they
remained for ever and had offspring, which, however, was
entirely spiritual; for they were neither married nor were
their embraces supposed to be like those of corporeal beings.<a name="FNanchor_230_847" id="FNanchor_230_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_847" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>In general the situation of <i>po</i> or the land of the dead
seems to have been left vague and indefinite by the Society
Islanders; apparently they did not, like the Western
Polynesians, imagine it to be in some far western isle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
to reach which the souls of the departed had to cross a
wide expanse of sea.<a name="FNanchor_231_848" id="FNanchor_231_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_848" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> However, the natives of Raiatea
had very definite ideas on this mysterious subject. They
thought that <i>po</i> was situated in a mysterious and unexplored
cavern at the top of the highest mountain in the island.
This cavern, perhaps the crater of a volcano, was said to
communicate, by subterranean passages, with a cave on the
coast, the opening of which is so small that a child of two
years could hardly creep into it. Here an evil spirit (<i>varu
iino</i>) was said to lurk and, pouncing out on careless passers-by,
to drag them into the darkest recesses of his den and devour
them. After the conversion of the natives to Christianity
the missionaries were shown the spot. Near it were the ruins
of a temple of the war god, where multitudes of the corpses of
warriors slain in battle had been either buried or left to rot
on the ground. The missionaries saw many mouldering
fragments of skeletons. Not far off a cape jutted into the
sea, up the lofty and precipitous face of which the souls
of the dead were said to climb on their way to their long
home in the cavern at the top of the mountain. A native
informant assured the missionaries that he had often seen
them scaling the dizzy crag, both men and women.<a name="FNanchor_232_849" id="FNanchor_232_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_849" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>In the island of Borabora the fate even of kings after
death was believed to be a melancholy one. Their souls were
converted into a piece of furniture resembling an English hat-stand;
only in Borabora the corresponding utensil was the
branch of a tree with the lateral forks cut short, on which
bonnets, garments, baskets, and so forth were suspended.
The natives very naturally concluded that in the other world
a similar stand was wanted for the convenience of the ghosts,
to hang their hats and coats on. Kings who shrank from
the prospect of being converted into a hat-stand after death
made interest with the priest to save them from such a
degradation. So when a king who had been great and
powerful in life saw his end approaching, he would send to
the priests the most costly presents, such as four or five of
the largest and fattest hogs, as many of the best canoes, and
any rare and valuable European article which he happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
to possess. In return the priests prayed for him daily at
the temples till he died; and afterwards his dead body was
brought to one of these sacred edifices and kept upright
there for several days and nights, during which yet larger
gifts were sent by his relatives, and the most expensive
sacrifices offered to the idols. The decaying corpse was then
removed, placed on a canoe, and rowed out on the lagoon as
far as an opening in the reef, only to be brought back again
in like manner; while all the time the priests recited their
prayers and performed their lugubrious ceremonies over it
on the water as well as on the land. Finally, the mouldering
remains were laid out to rot on a platform in one of the
usual charnel-houses.<a name="FNanchor_233_850" id="FNanchor_233_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_850" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Conversion into a hat-stand was not, perhaps, the worst
that could happen to the soul of a Society Islander after
death. In the island of Raiatea there is a lake surrounded
by trees, the tops of which appear curiously flat. On this
verdant platform the spirits of the newly departed were said
to dance and feast together until, at a subsequent stage of
their existence, they were converted into cockroaches.<a name="FNanchor_234_851" id="FNanchor_234_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_851" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> The
souls of infants killed at birth were supposed to return in the
bodies of grasshoppers.<a name="FNanchor_235_852" id="FNanchor_235_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_852" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>But the Society Islanders were far from thinking that
the souls of the dead herded together indiscriminately in
the other world. They imagined that the spirits were discriminated
and assigned to abodes of different degrees of
happiness or misery, not according to their virtues or vices
in this life, but according to the rank which they had
occupied in society, one receptacle of superior attractions
being occupied by the souls of chiefs and other principal
people, while another of an inferior sort sufficed to lodge the
souls of the lower orders. For they did not suppose that
their good or bad actions in this life affected in the least
their lot in the life hereafter, or that the deities took account
of any such distinction. Thus their religion exerted no
influence on their morality.<a name="FNanchor_236_853" id="FNanchor_236_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_853" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Happiness and misery in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
world beyond the grave, we are told, "were the destiny of
individuals, altogether irrespective of their moral character
and virtuous conduct. The only crimes that were visited
by the displeasure of their deities were the neglect of
some rite or ceremony, or the failing to furnish required
offerings."<a name="FNanchor_237_854" id="FNanchor_237_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_854" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The Society Islanders, especially the natives of the Leeward
Islands, believed that some of the souls of the dead
were destined to enjoy a kind of heaven or paradise, which
they called <i>Rohutu noanoa</i>, "sweet-scented Rohutu." This
blissful region was supposed to be near a lofty and stupendous
mountain in the island of Raiatea, not far from the
harbour Hamaniino. The mountain went by the name of
<i>Temehani unauna</i>, "splendid or glorious Temehani." It was
probably the same with the lofty mountain on whose summit
popular fancy placed the <i>po</i> or common abode of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_238_855" id="FNanchor_238_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_855" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
But the paradise was invisible to mortal eyes, being situated
in the regions of the air (<i>reva</i>). The country was described
as most lovely and enchanting in appearance, adorned with
flowers of every shape and hue, and perfumed with odours of
every fragrance. The air was pure and salubrious. Every sort
of delight was to be enjoyed there; while rich viands and
delicious fruits were supplied in abundance for the celebration
of sumptuous festivals. Handsome youths and women
thronged the place. But these honours and pleasures
were only for the privileged orders&mdash;the chiefs and the
members of the society of the Areois&mdash;for only they could
afford to pay the heavy charges which the priests exacted
for a passport to paradise; common folk seldom or never
dreamed of attempting to procure for their relatives admission
to the abode of bliss. Even apart from the expense
of getting to heaven, it is probable that the sharp distinction
kept up between chiefs and commoners here on earth would
be expected to be maintained hereafter, and to exclude every
person of the humbler sort from the society of his betters
in the future life.<a name="FNanchor_239_856" id="FNanchor_239_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_856" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The other less exclusive, and no doubt
less expensive, place for departed spirits, in contrast to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
"sweet-scented Rohutu," went by the significant name of
"foul-scented Rohutu"; but over the nature of the substances
which earned for it this unsavoury appellation our
missionary authority preferred to draw a veil.<a name="FNanchor_240_857" id="FNanchor_240_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_857" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>According to one account, the souls of the dead were
supposed to gather in the sun, where they feasted with the
god Maouwe or O-Mauwee (Maui) on bread-fruit and the
flesh of pigs or dogs, and drank never-ending draughts
of kava.<a name="FNanchor_241_858" id="FNanchor_241_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_858" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>But wherever the souls of the dead were imagined to
dwell, we may infer that they were credited with the power
of returning to earth for a longer or shorter time to benefit
or injure the living. For we have seen that sickness and
death were commonly ascribed to the action of these spirits,<a name="FNanchor_242_859" id="FNanchor_242_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_859" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
which seems to imply that they revisited this sublunary
world on their errands of mischief. Accordingly, whenever
the natives approached by night one of the charnel-houses
in which dead bodies were exposed, they were startled "in
the same manner that many of our ignorant and superstitious
people are with the apprehension of ghosts, and at
the sight of a churchyard." Again, the souls of the departed
were sometimes thought to communicate with their
friends in dreams and to announce to them things that should
afterwards come to pass, thus enabling the dreamer to foretell
the future. Foreknowledge thus acquired, however, was
confined to particular persons, and such favoured dreamers
enjoyed a reputation little inferior to that of the inspired
priests. One of them prophesied to Captain Cook on the
strength of a communication vouchsafed to him by the soul
of his deceased father in a dream; but the event proved
that the ghost was out in his reckoning by five days.<a name="FNanchor_243_860" id="FNanchor_243_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_860" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>The fear of ghosts in the minds of the Society Islanders
has long survived their conversion to Christianity; indeed,
we are informed that it is as rampant as ever. No ordinary
native would dare to visit one of the lonely caves where the
mouldering bones or skulls of his forefathers were deposited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
for safety in days of old.<a name="FNanchor_244_861" id="FNanchor_244_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_861" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> At one point on the western
coast of Tahiti, where the mountains advance in precipices
close to the sea, the road which skirts their base is a place
of fear to the natives. For in these precipices are caves full
of skulls, and the ghosts who reside in the caverns are
reported sometimes to weary of their own society and to
come down to the road for company, where in a sportive
vein they play all sorts of tricks on passers-by. Not so
long ago three Tahitians were riding home at dusk from
Papeete, where they had been drinking rum. Just at the
pass under the cliff they were surprised by ghosts, who
threw them into the ditch at the side of the road. So great
is the dread which the natives entertain of apparitions at this
spot that the Government has been compelled to divert the
road, so that it no longer skirts the foot of the haunted
mountain, but gives it a wide berth, and runs in a long
sweep by the edge of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_245_862" id="FNanchor_245_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_862" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Again, at another point on the west coast of Tahiti,
where mighty mountains, a glorious sea, and little coral
islands with their groves of palms, offer a view of enchanting
beauty, there is said to be a cave containing the skulls of
chiefs in a jutting cliff half-way up the mountain. The cave
was in charge of an old man in whose family the office of
guardian was hereditary. It had been entrusted to him by
his father on his deathbed, and the son had kept the secret
faithfully ever since. In vain did a traveller seek to persuade
the old man to guide him to the cave; in vain did
the chief himself beg of him to reveal the grotto which
concealed the mouldering relics of his forefathers. The
guardian was obdurate; he believed that the world was
not wide enough to hold two men who knew the holy place.
He assured the traveller that nobody could reach the cave
without the help of the ghosts, so perpendicular and so smooth
was the face of the cliff that led up to it. When he himself
wished to make his way to it, his custom was to go to the
foot of the crag and pray, till the spirits came and wafted
him lightly up and down again; otherwise it would have
been a sheer impossibility for him to ascend and descend.<a name="FNanchor_246_863" id="FNanchor_246_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_863" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<h4>&sect; 10. <i>The Worship of the Dead</i></h4>

<p>The belief in the existence of the spirits of the dead,
and in their power to help or harm the living, naturally
led the Society Islanders, like so many other peoples of the
world, to propitiate these powerful beings, to sue their favour,
or to appease their anger by prayer and sacrifice, in short,
to worship them. On this subject the first missionaries to
these islanders tell us that, in addition to the greater gods,
"for general worship they have an inferior race, a kind of
<i>dii penates</i>. Each family has its <i>tee</i> or guardian spirit: he
is supposed to be one of their departed relatives, who, for
his superior excellences, has been exalted into an <i>eatooa</i>
(<i>atua</i>). They suppose this spirit can inflict sickness or
remove it, and preserve them from a malignant deity who
also bears the name <i>tee</i>, and is always employed in mischief."<a name="FNanchor_247_864" id="FNanchor_247_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_864" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
"Every family has its <i>tee</i>, or guardian spirit, whom
they set up, and worship at the <i>morai</i>."<a name="FNanchor_248_865" id="FNanchor_248_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_865" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> "They regard the
spirits of their ancestors, male and female, as exalted into
<i>eatooas</i> (<i>atuas</i>) and their favour to be secured by prayers
and offerings. Every sickness and untoward accident they
esteem as the hand of judgment for some offence committed."<a name="FNanchor_249_866" id="FNanchor_249_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_866" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
As for the mischievous spirit who bore the same
name as the worshipful spirit of a dead ancestor, the missionaries
say that "the evil demon named <i>Tee</i> has no power
but upon earth; and this he exercises by getting into them
with their food, and causing madness or other diseases;
but these they imagine their tutelar saints, if propitious, can
prevent or remove."<a name="FNanchor_250_867" id="FNanchor_250_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_867" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>We may suspect that the missionaries were mistaken in
thus sharply distinguishing between an "evil demon" and a
"tutelar saint," both of whom went by the same name (<i>tee</i>).
Probably the "evil demon" and the "tutelar saint" were
alike supposed to be souls of dead persons, with this difference
between them, that whereas the one had been good and
beneficent in his life, the other had been bad and maleficent;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
for it is a common belief that the dead retain in the other
world the character and disposition which they manifested
on earth, and that accordingly as disembodied spirits they
may benefit or injure their surviving relatives.<a name="FNanchor_251_868" id="FNanchor_251_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_868" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Thus
according to his character and behaviour in this present
state of existence a person's ghost may naturally develop
either into a god or into a devil.</p>

<p>It is to be feared that in the case of Tahitian ghosts the
course of spiritual evolution was rather in the direction of
devilry than of deity. At least this conclusion seems
forced on us by the account which William Ellis, perhaps
our best authority on Tahitian religion, gives of the character
of these worshipful beings. I will reproduce it in his own
words.</p>

<p>"The objects of worship among the Tahitians, next to
the <i>atua</i> or gods, were the <i>oramatuas tiis</i> or spirits. These
were supposed to reside in the <i>po</i>, or world of night, and
were never invoked but by wizards or sorcerers, who implored
their aid for the destruction of an enemy, or the injury of
some person whom they were hired to destroy. They were
considered a different order of beings from the gods, a kind
of intermediate class between them and the human race,
though in their prayers all the attributes of the gods were
ascribed to them. The <i>oramatuas</i> were the spirits of departed
fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, children, etc. The natives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
were greatly afraid of them, and presented offerings to avoid
being cursed or destroyed, when they were employed by the
sorcerers.</p>

<p>"They seem to have been regarded as a sort of demons.
In the Leeward Islands, the chief <i>oramatuas</i> were spirits of
departed warriors, who had distinguished themselves by
ferocity and murder, attributes of character usually supposed
to belong to these evil genii. Each celebrated <i>tii</i> was honoured
with an image, through which it was supposed his influence
was exerted. The spirits of the reigning chiefs were united
to this class, and the skulls of deceased rulers, kept with the
images, were honoured with the same worship. Some idea
of what was regarded as their ruling passion, may be inferred
from the fearful apprehensions constantly entertained by all
classes. They were supposed to be exceedingly irritable and
cruel, avenging with death the slightest insult or neglect, and
were kept within the precincts of the temple. In the <i>marae</i>
of Tane at Maeva, the ruins of their abode were still standing
when I last visited the place. It was a house built upon
a number of large strong poles, which raised the floor ten or
twelve feet from the ground. They were thus elevated, to
keep them out of the way of men, as it was imagined they
were constantly strangling, or otherwise destroying, the chiefs
and people. To prevent this, they were also treated with
great respect; men were appointed constantly to attend
them, and to keep them wrapped in the choicest kinds of
cloth, to take them out whenever there was a <i>pae atua</i>, or
general exhibition of the gods; to anoint them frequently
with fragrant oil; and to sleep in the house with them at
night. All this was done, to keep them pacified. And
though the office of calming the angry spirits was honourable,
it was regarded as dangerous, for if, during the night or at
any other time, these keepers were guilty of the least impropriety,
it was supposed the spirits of the images, or the
skulls, would hurl them headlong from their high abodes,
and break their necks in the fall."<a name="FNanchor_252_869" id="FNanchor_252_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_869" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>The difference in power and dignity between the great
national gods (<i>atuas</i>) and the spirits of deceased relations
(<i>oramatuas tiis</i>) might be measured by the size of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
images; for whereas the images of the gods were six or
eight feet long, those of the spirits were not more than so many
inches.<a name="FNanchor_253_870" id="FNanchor_253_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_870" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> But while these malignant and irritable spirits&mdash;the
souls of dead fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and children&mdash;resided
generally either in their little images or in their
skulls, they were not strictly confined to these material
vehicles; they resorted occasionally to the shells from the
seashore, especially to a beautiful kind of murex, the <i>Murex
ramoces</i>. These shells were kept by the sorcerers, and the
peculiar singing or humming sound that may be heard when
the valve is applied to the ear was imagined to proceed from
the demon in the shell.<a name="FNanchor_254_871" id="FNanchor_254_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_871" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>It was these malignant and dangerous demons whom
the sorcerer employed as his agents to execute his fell purposes.
But to effect them he had to secure something
connected with the body of his intended victim, it might be
the parings of his nails, a lock of his hair, his spittle or other
bodily secretions, or else a portion of the food which he was
about to eat. Over this material substance, whatever it
was, the sorcerer recited his incantations and performed his
magical rites either in his own house or in his private temple
(<i>marae</i>). The result was believed to be that the demon
entered into the substance, and through it passed into the
body of the man at whom the enchanter aimed his elfish
darts. The wretched sufferer experienced the acutest agonies;
his distortions were frightful to witness; his eyes seemed
starting from his head; he foamed at the mouth; he lay
writhing in anguish on the ground; in short, to adopt the
native expression, he was torn by the evil spirit. Yet his case
was not hopeless; the demon could be mollified by a bribe,
or defeated by the intervention of a more powerful demon.
Hence, when any one was believed to be suffering from the
incantations of a sorcerer, if he or his friends were rich enough
they engaged another sorcerer for a fee to counteract the
spells of the first and so to restore the health of the invalid.
It was generally supposed that the efforts of the second sorcerer
would be crowned with success if only the demon whom
he employed were equally powerful with that at the command
of his rival, and if the presents which he received for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
professional services were more valuable. In order to avoid
the danger of being thus bewitched through the refuse of
their persons, the Tahitians used scrupulously to burn or
bury their shorn hair, lest it should fall into the hands of
enchanters.<a name="FNanchor_255_872" id="FNanchor_255_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_872" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>It is possible that some even of the great national gods were
no more than ghosts of dead men, whose human origin was
forgotten. There is some reason for supposing that this was
true of Hiro, the god of thieves. On the one hand, this deity
was reputed to be the son of the great god Oro;<a name="FNanchor_256_873" id="FNanchor_256_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_873" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and when
a mother desired her child to grow up a clever thief, she
repaired to a temple, where the priest, on receipt of the
requisite offerings, caught the spirit of the god in a snare
and infused it into the infant, thus ensuring the future
proficiency of the infant in the arts of theft and robbery.<a name="FNanchor_257_874" id="FNanchor_257_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_874" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
Yet, in spite of these claims to divinity, there are some
grounds for thinking that Hiro was himself originally no
better than a thief and a robber. He is said to have been
a native of Raiatea, from whose sacrilegious fingers not even
the temples and altars of the gods were safe. His skull was
shown in a large temple of his own construction in that
island down to the early years of the nineteenth century.
His hair, too, was stuffed into the image of his reputed father,
the god Oro, and perished when that image was committed
to the flames by the early converts to Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_258_875" id="FNanchor_258_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_875" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>Once a year the Society Islanders celebrated a festival
accompanied by rites, of which one has been compared to
the Roman Catholic custom of performing a mass for the
benefit of souls in purgatory. The festival was called "the
ripening of the year," and the time for its observance was
determined by the blossoming of reeds. It was regularly
observed in the island of Huahine, and vast multitudes
assembled to take part in it. As a rule, only men engaged
in the pagan festivals, but at this particular one women and
children were also present, though they were not allowed to
enter the sacred enclosure. The celebration was regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
as a kind of annual acknowledgment made to the gods.
Prayers were offered at the temple, and a sumptuous banquet
formed part of the festival. At the close of the festival
every one returned to his home, or to his family temple
(<i>marae</i>), there to offer special prayers for the spirits of departed
relatives, that they might be liberated from the <i>po</i>, or
state of Night, and might either ascend to paradise ("sweet-scented
Rohutu") or return to this world by entering into
the body of one of its inhabitants. But "they did not
suppose, according to the generally received doctrine of transmigration,
that the spirits who entered the body of some
dweller upon earth, would permanently remain there, but only
come and inspire the person to declare future events, or
execute any other commission from the supernatural beings
on whom they imagined they were constantly dependent."<a name="FNanchor_259_876" id="FNanchor_259_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_876" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Hence we learn that the spirits of the dead as well as
the gods were believed to be capable of inspiring men and
revealing to them the future. In this, as in other respects,
the dead were assimilated to deities.</p>

ceremony observed at the installation
of a king was this. The king advanced
into the sea and bathed there. Thither
he was followed by the priest of Oro
bearing a branch plucked from a sacred
tree that grew within the precincts of
the temple. While the king was
bathing, the priest struck him on the
back with the holy bough, at the same
time invoking the great god Taaoroa.
This ceremony was designed to purify
the monarch from any defilement or

Moerenhout says that when a chief was
an Areoi, his first-born son was spared,
but all the rest were sacrificed; but
immediately afterwards he adds, with
apparent inconsistency, that "the first
(by which he seems to mean the principal)
Areois only killed their first sons
and all their daughters; the other male
infants were spared." See Moerenhout,
<i>op. cit.</i> i. 495, 496. These statements,
so far as I have observed, are not confirmed
by other writers.</p></div>

Moerenhout the latter.  See Waitz-Gerland,
<i>Anthropologie</i>, vi. 368 <i>sq.</i>;
J. A. Moerenhout, <i>op. cit.</i> i. 484.
The only evidence adduced by Moerenhout
for his interpretation of Oro as a
sun-god is a statement that in the
Marquesas Islands the Areois suspended
their performances and went into retreat
from April or May till the vernal
equinox (which in the southern hemisphere
falls in September), and that
during their retreat they assumed the
style of mourners and bewailed the
absence or death of their god, whom
they called Mahoui. This Mahoui is
accordingly taken by Moerenhout to
be the sun and equated to Oro, the
god of the Areois in the Society Islands.
But Mahoui seems to be no other than
the well-known Polynesian hero Maui,
who can hardly have been the sun (see
below, <a href="#Footnote_135_752">p. 286 note<sup>5</sup></a>); and Moerenhout's
statement as to the annual period of
mourning observed by the Areois in
the Marquesas Islands is not, so far as
I know, confirmed by any other writer,
and must, therefore, be regarded as
open to doubt. His statement and
his interpretation of Oro and Mahoui
were accepted by Dr. Rivers, who
made them the basis of his far-reaching
theory of a secret worship of the sun
introduced into the Pacific by immigrants
from a far northern country,
who also built the megalithic monuments
of Polynesia and Micronesia.
See W. H. R. Rivers, "Sun-cult and
Megaliths in Polynesia," <i>American
Anthropologist</i>, xvii. July-September
1915, pp. 431 <i>sqq.</i> In proof of the
supposed connexion between these
megalithic monuments and a worship
of the sun, Dr. Rivers says (p. 440)
that the Areois "held their celebrations
in an enclosure called <i>marae</i> or
<i>marai</i>, at one end of which was situated
a pyramidical structure with steps
leading to a platform on which were
placed the images of the gods during
the religious celebrations of the people."
But if by "their celebrations" Dr.
Rivers means the ordinary dramatic,
musical, and athletic performances of
the Areois, he seems to be in error;
for it appears to be certain that these
exhibitions were regularly given, not
at the <i>maraes</i>, but in or before large
houses built or specially set apart for
the purpose. See above, pp. <a href="#Page_259">259 <i>sq.</i></a></p></div>

Ellis does not admit that Orotetefa
and Urutetefa were, strictly speaking,
the sons of Oro. He writes: "According
to the traditions of the people,
Taaroa created, and, by means of
Hina, brought forth when full grown
Orotetefa and Urutetefa. They were
not his sons; <i>oriori</i> is the term employed
by the people, which seems to
mean <i>create</i>" (<i>op. cit.</i> i. 230). With
regard to Hina (Heena), interpreted as
the moon, or the goddess of the moon,
see J. R. Forster, <i>Observations</i>, p.
549; G. Forster, <i>Voyage</i>, ii. 152; J. A.

<i>s.v.</i> "Hina," "Hina is by far the best
known of all Polynesian legendary personages.
In the more easterly islands
she is a goddess, and is almost certainly
the Moon-goddess." Similarly Mr. E. E. V.
Collocot observes that Hina "is
generally regarded as the Moon-goddess,
and this view was spontaneously put
forward by a Tongan; in conversation
with me" (<i>Journal of the Polynesian
Society</i>, xxx. (1921) p. 238).</p></div>

the sides of an area, walled in with
square stones and paved with flat stones:
the pyramid is not solid, but the inside
is filled with smaller fragments of coral
stones."</p></div>

The ruins of two <i>maraes</i> in the

The great pyramid was afterwards
visited and described by the first
missionaries. Their measurements
confirm, while slightly exceeding,
those of Captain Cook. They speak,
however, of ten steps instead of eleven,
and say that the lowest step was six
feet high and the rest about five. See

they rendered divine homage either
to the sun or moon" (<i>Polynesian
Researches</i>, iii. 171). Speaking of
the Areois, Moerenhout says that
"it seems to me clear that though they
did not adore directly the sun and
the other stars, nevertheless their
worship was little else than sabeism or
the adoration of the visible and animated
universe" (<i>op. cit.</i> i. 503). He interpreted
both Oro and Maui or Mahoui
(as he spells the name) as the sun-god
(<i>op. cit.</i> i. 484, 502, 503, 560 <i>sq.</i>);
but these interpretations appear to
be his own guesses, unsupported by
any statement of the natives. Maui was
the great Polynesian hero, one of whose
most famous exploits was catching the
sun in a snare and compelling him to
move more slowly (E. Tregear, <i>Maori-Polynesian
Comparative Dictionary</i>,
pp. 234 <i>sqq.</i>, <i>s.v.</i> "Maui"; see above,
p. <a href="#Page_275">275</a>); but this story, far from favouring
the identification of Maui with the
sun, seems fatal to it. According to J. R.
Forster, the great god Taroa (Taaroa)
was thought to have created the sun
and to dwell in it (<i>Observations</i>, p. 540);
but even if this statement is correct, it
hardly implies a worship of the sun.
With regard to the moon, the same
writer tells us (<i>l.c.</i>) that it was supposed
to be procreated by a goddess named
O-Heena, "who presides in the black
cloud which appears in this luminary";
and the statement is repeated by his
son, George Forster, who adds: "The
women sing a short couplet, which
seems to be an act of adoration paid
to that divinity [O-Heena], perhaps
because they suppose her to have some
influence upon their physical &#339;conomy.... 'The cloud within the moon, that
cloud I love'" (<i>Voyage round the
World</i>, ii. 152). This so far seems to
imply a reverence for the moon; and
there are some grounds for thinking
that O-Heena or Hina (as the name is
usually spelt) was in Eastern Polynesia
a moon-goddess. See above, <a href="#Footnote_69_686">p. 267, note<sup>2</sup></a>.</p></div>

to Ellis, the mummers were
supposed to be inspired by the spirit of
the deceased; according to Moerenhout,
they were not inspired by, but merely
represented, the ghost. The difference
between spiritual representation and inspiration
is somewhat fine; too fine
perhaps to be apprehended by Tahitian
intelligence. Forster says that the procession
started from the house of the
deceased, Ellis that it started from a
valley.</p></div>

In the southern peninsula of Tahiti,
both on the coast and inland, Captain
Cook saw many sepulchral buildings,
and he described them as "decorated
with many carved boards, which were
set upright, and on the top of which
were various figures of birds and men:
on one in particular there was the
representation of a cock, which was
painted red and yellow, to imitate the
feathers of that animal, and rude
images of men were, in some of them,
placed one upon the head of another."
See J. Cook, <i>Voyages</i>, i. 150 <i>sq.</i>
These "carved boards" were no
doubt of the same sort as the <i>tees</i>
or <i>teehees</i> described by the two
Forsters. No other writer seems to
mention the figures of birds carved on
them.</p></div>

that the missionaries mistook a general
name (<i>tee</i>, otherwise spelled <i>tii</i>) for the
name of a particular demon, I may
point out that the naturalist J. R.
Forster before them seems to have fallen
into precisely the same mistake with
regard to another general name for
departed spirits (<i>oramatuas</i> or <i>oromatuas</i>).
Thus he writes: "Besides these
divinities of the second class, there are
others of a still inferior rank, and
though called <i>Eatooas</i>, are no more
than what the Greek or Roman mythologists
would have called <i>Genii</i>, or
<i>Dii minorum gentium</i>: one of them,
called <i>Orometooa</i>, is of a malignant disposition,
resides chiefly near the <i>Marais</i>
and <i>Toopapous</i> (places of burial) and in
or near the boxes, or little chests, including
the heads of their deceased
friends, each of which, on that account,
is called <i>Te-wharre no te Orometooa</i>,
the house of the evil genius <i>Orometooa</i>,
The people at Taheitee are of opinion,
that if their priests invoke this evil
genius, he will kill, by a sudden death,
the person on whom they intend to
bring down the vengeance of this
divinity." See J. R. Forster, <i>Observations
made during a Voyage round the
World</i>, pp. 541 <i>sq.</i> In this passage
we can hardly doubt that "this evil
genius," Orometooa, is simply the <i>oramatuas</i>
or <i>oromatuas</i>, the spirits of the
dead, by means of whom sorcerers were
supposed to injure or destroy any one
at whom they or their employers had
a grudge. See above, p. <a href="#Page_299">299</a>, and

<h3>THE BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY AMONG THE MARQUESANS</h3>


<h4>&sect; 1. <i>The Marquesas Islands</i></h4>

<p>The Marquesas are an archipelago of eleven or twelve chief
islands in the South Pacific, situated about nine hundred
miles to the north-east of Tahiti. They fall into two groups,
which together stretch in a direction from north-west to
south-east, from 8&deg; to 11&deg; of South latitude. The south-eastern
group, of which Hivaoa (Dominica) is the largest
island, was discovered by the Spanish Admiral Alvaro Mendana
de Neyra in 1595, but, so far as appears, it was not
again visited by Europeans until 1774, when Captain Cook
touched at the islands on his second voyage. Curiously
enough, the north-westerly group, of which Nukahiva is the
largest and most important island, remained unknown until
1791, when it was discovered by the American Captain
Ingraham, who named the group the Washington Islands.
About a month later, in June 1791, the French navigator
Marchand visited the same islands, and in 1797 the first
missionary, William Crook, was landed from the missionary
ship <i>Duff</i>. The whole archipelago is now known as the
Marquesas, a name which the Spanish Admiral Mendana
bestowed on the islands discovered by him in honour of the
Marquess de Canete, Viceroy of Peru, by whose order the
voyage had been undertaken.<a name="FNanchor_1_877" id="FNanchor_1_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_877" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>The islands are of volcanic formation, lofty and mountainous.
The interior consists generally of a range of
mountains some three thousand feet high, from which a
series of spurs descend steeply to the coast, terminating for
the most part in tremendous cliffs, at the foot of which the
great rollers break in foam; for with a single exception there
are no coral reefs, and a ship can sail in deep water within
a cable's length of the rocks. Viewed at a distance from the
sea, the aspect of the islands is somewhat stern and forbidding.
Bare mountains, jagged peaks, sometimes lost in
the clouds, and an iron-bound coast of black and beetling
crags, buffeted eternally by the surf, make up a gloomy
picture; but a nearer view discloses verdant valleys nestling
between the ridges which radiate from the central mountains.
These valleys are watered by mountain streams and clothed
with dense tropical vegetation, their luxuriant green offering
an agreeable contrast to the bareness and aridity of the
frowning precipices and sharp peaks which soar above them.
Cascades tumbling from high cliffs into the depths of the
glens add to the beauty and charm of the scenery. So steep
and precipitous are the ridges which divide these smiling
vales from each other that the ascent and descent are in
many places both difficult and dangerous even for the
natives; European mountaineers need to have stout limbs
and steady heads to accomplish them in safety. Hence in
former days each valley contained a separate tribe, which
was commonly in a state of permanent hostility towards its
neighbours across the mountain barriers.<a name="FNanchor_2_878" id="FNanchor_2_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_878" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Of these tribes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
the most famous were the warlike and dreaded Taipiis or
Typees, who occupied a beautiful valley at the eastern end
of Nukahiva, and in their mountain fastness deemed themselves
inaccessible to their enemies. However, in the early
part of the nineteenth century an American naval officer,
Captain David Porter, succeeded, not without great difficulty,
in carrying havoc and devastation into these sylvan scenes.<a name="FNanchor_3_879" id="FNanchor_3_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_879" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Later in the century a runaway American sailor, Hermann
Melville, spent more than four months as a captive
in the tribe, and published an agreeable narrative of his
captivity; but never having mastered the language, he
was not able to give much exact information concerning
the customs and beliefs of the natives.<a name="FNanchor_4_880" id="FNanchor_4_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_880" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> As there is no
maritime plain interposed between the mountains and the
shore, the only way of passing from one valley to another
is either to go by sea or to clamber over the intervening
ridges. It would be materially impossible, we are told,
unless at enormous and ruinous cost, to make a road or
even a mule-path round any of the Marquesas Islands, as
has been done in Tahiti.<a name="FNanchor_5_881" id="FNanchor_5_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_881" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Despite their situation in the heart of the tropics, the
Marquesas enjoy an extremely healthy climate subject to
none of the inconveniences usually incidental to countries
in the same latitude; endemic and epidemic diseases are
alike unknown. European soldiers can work in the sun
without accident and without exhaustion.<a name="FNanchor_6_882" id="FNanchor_6_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_882" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The climate
has been described as an eternal spring, without winter
or even autumn; though a perpetual succession of ripe fruits
may seem to lend an autumnal air to the landscape, which
yet is never chilled by hoar frosts or saddened by the sight
of bare boughs and fallen leaves.<a name="FNanchor_7_883" id="FNanchor_7_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_883" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Even in the hottest days
a cool wind blows from the sea, and at night there is a breeze
from the land. Rain falls during some months of the year,
especially from May or June to August or September; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
on the whole there is little variation in the seasons;<a name="FNanchor_8_884" id="FNanchor_8_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_884" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the
Marquesan year has been described as one long tropical
month of June just melting into July.<a name="FNanchor_9_885" id="FNanchor_9_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_885" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Yet we are told that
the northern islands sometimes suffer from droughts which
may last for years; at such times vegetation languishes,
till a fresh cloud-burst restores the verdure of the trees and
grass as by magic.<a name="FNanchor_10_886" id="FNanchor_10_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_886" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is then, too, that the cascades everywhere
enliven the landscape by the glitter and roar of their
tumbling waters, which, after dropping from the height, flow
rapidly down their steep beds into the sea.<a name="FNanchor_11_887" id="FNanchor_11_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_887" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 2. <i>Physical Appearance of the Natives</i></h4>

<p>Observers are generally agreed that from the purely
physical point of view the Marquesan islanders are, or used
to be, the noblest specimens of the Polynesian race. Captain
Cook remarked that "the inhabitants of these islands collectively
are, without exception, the finest race of people in
this sea. For fine shape and regular features, they perhaps
surpass all other nations."<a name="FNanchor_12_888" id="FNanchor_12_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_888" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> To the same effect the naturalist
George Forster, who accompanied Captain Cook, gives his
impression of a crowd of Marquesan men, among whom
were no women. He says: "They were tall, and extremely
well limbed; not one of them unwieldy or corpulent like a
Taheitian, nor meagre and shrivelled like a native of Easter
Island. The punctuation" (by which he meant the tattooing)
"which almost entirely covered the men of a middle
age, made it difficult to distinguish their elegance of form;
but among the youths, who were not yet marked or tattooed,
it was easy to discover beauties singularly striking, and often
without a blemish, such as demanded the admiration of all
beholders. Many of them might be placed near the famous
models of antiquity, and would not suffer in the comparison:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>
<p>"The natural colour of these youths was not quite so
dark as that of the common people in the Society Isles; but
the men appeared to be infinitely blacker, on account of the
punctures which covered their whole body, from head to foot.
These punctures were disposed with the utmost regularity;
so that the marks on each leg, arm, and cheek, and on the
corresponding muscles, were exactly similar. They never
assumed the determinate form of an animal or plant, but
consisted of a variety of blotches, spirals, bars, chequers, and
lines, which had a most motley appearance."<a name="FNanchor_13_889" id="FNanchor_13_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_889" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Similarly, speaking of the Taipiis or Typees, Melville
observes, "In beauty of form they surpassed anything I
had ever seen. Not a single instance of natural deformity
was observable in all the throng attending the revels.
Occasionally I noticed among the men the scars of wounds
they had received in battle; and sometimes, though very
seldom, the loss of a finger, an eye, or an arm, attributable
to the same cause. With these exceptions, every individual
appeared free from those blemishes which sometimes mar
the effect of an otherwise perfect form. But their physical
excellence did not merely consist in an exemption from these
evils; nearly every individual of their number might have
been taken for a sculptor's model."<a name="FNanchor_14_890" id="FNanchor_14_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_890" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> As to their stature, the
same writer affirms that "the men, in almost every instance,
are of lofty stature, scarcely ever less than six feet."<a name="FNanchor_15_891" id="FNanchor_15_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_891" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Similarly
Captain Porter tell us that "they are far above the
common stature of the human race, seldom less than five feet
eleven inches, but most commonly six feet two or three
inches, and every way proportioned. Their faces are remarkably
handsome, with keen, piercing eyes; teeth white, and
more beautiful than ivory; countenances open and expressive,
which reflect every emotion of their souls; limbs which
might serve as models for a statuary, and strength and
activity proportioned to their appearance."<a name="FNanchor_16_892" id="FNanchor_16_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_892" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Another observer
remarks of them that "the natives bear the palm for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
personal beauty from most other of the Polynesian tribes.
The men are tall and muscular, though rather slightly
framed; their deportment is graceful and independent;
their features are handsome, and partake more of the
European regularity of profile than is usual with Polynesian
islanders."<a name="FNanchor_17_893" id="FNanchor_17_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_893" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The nose is straight or aquiline,
sometimes short or slightly flattened, but never ill-shaped:
the mouth is never large nor the lips thick: the forehead
is rather low and somewhat retreating.<a name="FNanchor_18_894" id="FNanchor_18_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_894" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The hair
is almost always straight or wavy; men or women with
frizzly hair are very seldom seen, especially in the north-western
group. The colour of the skin, where it is not
darkened by tattooing, is a clear brown, resembling the
bronzed appearance acquired by Europeans through exposure
to a tropical sun.<a name="FNanchor_19_895" id="FNanchor_19_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_895" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The women are both absolutely and
relatively shorter than the men; indeed Melville describes
them as "uncommonly diminutive." Their complexion is
lighter; in the parts of the body which are seldom exposed
to the sun they are even said to appear as white as European
women. Their features are good, but rather pretty than
beautiful; their hands and feet are very shapely. Unlike
the men, who are, or used to be, tattooed from head to foot,
the women were tattooed very little, and that chiefly on the
lips.<a name="FNanchor_20_896" id="FNanchor_20_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_896" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> They took pains to whiten their skin by avoiding
exposure to the sun and by washing themselves with the
juice of a small native vine,<a name="FNanchor_21_897" id="FNanchor_21_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_897" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> or by smearing themselves with
a cosmetic in which the yellow of the turmeric root predominated.<a name="FNanchor_22_898" id="FNanchor_22_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_898" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 3. <i>Food, Weapons, Tools, Houses, Canoes, Fishing</i></h4>

<p>The Marquesans subsist chiefly on a vegetable diet.
Their staple food is the bread-fruit, and their national dish
is a paste called <i>popoi</i>, which is prepared from bread-fruit
after it has been subjected to a process of fermentation. Fish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
is also a common article of diet; the natives usually eat it
raw, even when it is rotten and stinking. They keep pigs,
but seldom kill them except for a festival or at the reception
of a stranger. Hence pork is not a regular or common
article of diet with them; and apart from it they hardly taste
flesh. Other sorts of food, such as bananas, taro, and sugar-cane,
are entirely subsidiary to the great staples, bread-fruit
and fish. The natives do not readily accustom themselves
to a European diet; indeed when the experiment has been
made of feeding them exclusively in our manner, they have
wasted away and only recovered their health when they were
allowed to return to their usual nourishment. Their ordinary
beverage was water, but they were also addicted to the
drinking of kava, which was extracted from the root of
the <i>Piper methysticum</i> in the usual fashion.<a name="FNanchor_23_899" id="FNanchor_23_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_899" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Drawing their
sustenance chiefly from the bread-fruit tree, the Marquesans
paid little attention to the cultivation of the soil; however,
they grew a certain amount of taro, sweet potatoes, and sugar-cane;
and they had plantations of the paper-mulberry,<a name="FNanchor_24_900" id="FNanchor_24_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_900" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the
bark of which was manufactured by the women into cloth
in the ordinary way. But the bark of other trees was also
employed for the same purpose. Since the natives were able
to procure European stuffs, the indigenous manufacture of
bark-cloth has much declined.<a name="FNanchor_25_901" id="FNanchor_25_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_901" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Hence agriculture engaged
the men very little; fishing, though it was part of their
business, they are said to have neglected; the only work of
consequence they did was to build their houses and manufacture
their arms, but these employments occupied them
only occasionally.<a name="FNanchor_26_902" id="FNanchor_26_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_902" class="fnanchor">[26]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>The weapons of the warriors were clubs, spears, and
slings. The slings were made of coco-nut fibre, and the
natives were very expert in the use of them. Bows and
arrows were unknown.<a name="FNanchor_27_903" id="FNanchor_27_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_903" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Like the rest of the Polynesians,
the Marquesans were totally ignorant of the metals until they
acquired them from Europeans. Their tools were made of
stone, bone, and shell. Thus they employed a pointed stone
to bore holes with, and an axe of black, hard stone for cutting.
The axe-head was shaped like an elongated wedge
or mortise-chisel, and was fastened to the haft by coco-nut
fibre. Some of these axes weighed as much as twenty-five
pounds. The natives also used sharp-edged or toothed shells
as cutting implements, and borers made of pointed bones;
while rough fish-skins served them as polishers.<a name="FNanchor_28_904" id="FNanchor_28_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_904" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Like the
rest of the Polynesians, they kindled fire by the method
known as the stick-and-groove, that is, by rubbing the sharp
point of one stick against the flat surface of another, so as to
form a groove in it and, by continued friction, to elicit smoke
and a glow, which, with the help of dry leaves, is nursed into
a flame. Contrary to the usage of some peoples, the Marquesans
employed the same kind of wood for both the fire-sticks,
either a species of hibiscus (<i>Hibiscus tiliaceus</i>) or a
species of poplar (<i>Thespesia populnea</i>); for this purpose they
split a branch in two, lengthwise, and used the two pieces as
the fire-sticks. In former days these fire-sticks were regularly
kept in every native house.<a name="FNanchor_29_905" id="FNanchor_29_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_905" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The Marquesan houses are regularly built on stone platforms,
oblong or square in shape, and raised above the ground
to heights varying from one to four, eight, or even ten feet.
The higher platforms are approached from the ground by
ladders or notched poles. The houses, constructed of timber
and bamboo, are oblong in shape, and comprise a high back
wall, generally inclined forward at an angle, from which the
thatched roof slopes down steeply to a low front wall, while
two short walls close the house at either end. The door is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
in the middle of the front wall, and is so low that it is
necessary to stoop in entering. Sometimes the fronts of the
houses are entirely open except for the low pillars which
support the roof. The interior of the house forms a single
chamber undivided by partitions. Two trunks of coco-nut
palms extend parallel to each other along the whole length
of the floor at an interval of four or five feet; the innermost
log, a foot or two distant from the back wall, forms a pillow
on which the heads of the sleepers rest, while the other
supports their feet or legs. The space between the two logs
is paved with stone, and spread with mats. In the single
apartment the whole family live and sleep. Such at least
were the domestic arrangements in the old days. The size
of the houses naturally varies. Some of them measure eighty
feet by forty, others only twenty-five feet by ten, or even
less.<a name="FNanchor_30_906" id="FNanchor_30_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_906" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The platforms on which the houses are built consist often
of large blocks of stone neatly and regularly laid without
mortar or cement, in a style which would do no discredit to
European masons.<a name="FNanchor_31_907" id="FNanchor_31_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_907" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Sometimes the stones are described as
enormous blocks of rock,<a name="FNanchor_32_908" id="FNanchor_32_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_908" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> some of which would require ten
or twelve men to carry or roll them.<a name="FNanchor_33_909" id="FNanchor_33_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_909" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Water-worn boulders,
washed down from the mountains in the bed of torrents, were
especially chosen for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_34_910" id="FNanchor_34_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_910" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes, though far less commonly, Marquesan houses
were raised above the ground on posts from eight or ten
to sixteen feet high. Such houses were lightly built of
wood and thatched; the floor was an open work of split
bamboos. Sometimes these raised dwellings resembled the
ordinary Marquesan house in structure; at other times they
were quadrangular, with perpendicular walls and an ordinary
roof. They were approached by ladders and resembled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
habitations in use among the Malay tribes of the Indian
Archipelago. No dwellings of this type have been noticed
in Nukahiva, the principal island of the archipelago; but
they have been seen and described in Tauata (Santa Christina)
and Hivaoa (Dominica).<a name="FNanchor_35_911" id="FNanchor_35_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_911" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The Marquesans built canoes of various sizes, the smaller
for fishing, the larger for war. These latter might be from
forty to fifty feet long. They were fitted with outriggers.
The prow had an ornamental projection rudely carved to
represent the head of an animal. Sometimes the prows of war
canoes were decorated with the skulls of slaughtered enemies.
But in general the Marquesans appear to have been inferior
to the other South Sea islanders in the arts of canoe-building
and navigation.<a name="FNanchor_36_912" id="FNanchor_36_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_912" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This inferiority may perhaps have been
partly due to the absence of those lagoons which, formed by
coral reefs, elsewhere enabled the natives to acquire confidence
and skill in sailing on smooth and sheltered waters.
The same cause may also, perhaps, explain why fishing was
comparatively little practised by the Marquesans. We are
told that as an occupation it was despised by such as owned
a piece of land of any extent, and that only the poorer class
of people, who depended on the sea for a livelihood, addicted
themselves to it. They caught fish by means both of nets
and of lines with hooks neatly made of mother-of-pearl; also
they stupefied the fish by a certain mashed root, which the
fisherman distributed in the water by diving, and then caught
the fish as they rose to the surface.<a name="FNanchor_37_913" id="FNanchor_37_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_913" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 4. <i>Polyandry, Adoption, Exchange of Names</i></h4>

<p>The social life of the Marquesan islanders presented
some peculiar features. Thus they are said to have
practised the rare custom of polyandry. On this subject
Stewart observes: "We have yet met with no instance, in
any rank of society, of a male with two wives, but are
informed that for one woman to have two husbands is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
universal habit. Some favourite in the father's household
or retinue at an early period becomes the husband of the
daughter, who still remains under the paternal roof till
contracted in marriage to a second individual, on which she
removes with her first husband to his habitation, and both
herself and original companion are supported by him."<a name="FNanchor_38_914" id="FNanchor_38_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_914" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Melville describes the custom in substantially the same way,
and adds, "No man has more than one wife, and no wife
of mature years has less than two husbands,&mdash;sometimes
she has three, but such instances are not frequent." He
seems to have attributed the practice to a scarcity of
women; for he tells us that "the males considerably outnumber
the females."<a name="FNanchor_39_915" id="FNanchor_39_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_915" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The same view was taken at a
later date by Dr. Clavel, who observes: "In the islands
where the women are in a minority we may to this day
observe tolerably numerous cases of polyandry. Thus at
Ua-Una I met some women who had each two husbands,
almost always one of them young and the other old. Such
households of three are not worse than the rest and never
give rise to intestine dissensions."<a name="FNanchor_40_916" id="FNanchor_40_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_916" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> According to Radiguet,
the right of having more husbands than one was not general
and hardly belonged to any but chieftainesses,<a name="FNanchor_41_917" id="FNanchor_41_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_917" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> but this
limitation is denied by a good authority.<a name="FNanchor_42_918" id="FNanchor_42_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_918" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The Russian
navigator Lisiansky, who visited the Marquesas in 1804,
seems to have supposed that the custom was restricted to
wealthy families. He says: "In rich families, every woman
has two husbands; of whom one may be called the assistant
husband. This last, when the other is at home, is nothing
more than the head servant of the house; but, in case of
absence, exercises all the rights of matrimony, and is also
obliged to attend his lady wherever she goes. It happens
sometimes, that the subordinate partner is chosen after
marriage; but in general two men present themselves to the
same woman, who, if she approves their addresses, appoints
one for the real husband, and the other as his auxiliary: the
auxiliary is generally poor, but handsome and well-made."<a name="FNanchor_43_919" id="FNanchor_43_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_919" class="fnanchor">[43]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>Another peculiar habit of the Marquesans was to give
away their children to be adopted by other people soon
after their birth. When a woman was pregnant, she and
her husband would discuss to whom they should give the
child that was about to be born. They received offers from
neighbours, and often knocked down the infant to the
highest bidder; for the adopting parents regularly made
presents to the child's family, consisting of cloth, tools, and
pigs, according to the fortune of the contracting parties.
After birth the child remained with its mother for some
months till it was weaned, upon which it was sent away to
its parents by adoption, who might inhabit a different
district and even a different island. It is said to have been
exceptional for parents to bring up their own offspring.<a name="FNanchor_44_920" id="FNanchor_44_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_920" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Another mode by which the Marquesans created artificial
relationships was the exchange of names. Such an exchange
was equivalent to a ratification of amity and good-will
between the persons, who thereby acquired a claim to
mutual protection and the enjoyment of each other's
property and even of their wives, if they happened to be
married men. The custom was not limited to the natives;
they readily exchanged names with Europeans and granted
them the privileges which flowed from the pact. It is even
said that some natives gave their own names to animals,
which thenceforth became sacred for them and for the rest
of the tribe. This led to so many inconveniences that the
priests had to forbid the practice of exchanging names with
animals.<a name="FNanchor_45_921" id="FNanchor_45_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_921" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 5. <i>Amusements, Dancing-places, Banqueting-halls</i></h4>

<p>A favourite amusement of the islanders was racing or
combating on stilts. A stilt was composed of two pieces,
a pole of light wood which the runner held in his hand, and
a step or foot-rest of hard wood, on which he planted one
of his feet. The step or foot-rest was often adorned with
human figures curiously carved, which are said to have
represented gods. The races or combats took place on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
paved areas which were to be seen in most villages, and
which formed the scene of public entertainments. In these
contests each runner or combatant tried to get in the way of
his adversary, and, balancing himself on one stilt, to strike
his rival with the other, so as to bring him to the ground
amid the laughter and jeers of the spectators. It has
sometimes been supposed that the use of stilts in the
Marquesas originated in the practical purpose of enabling
people to cross a stream without wetting their feet. But
the supposition is highly improbable. For, on the one hand,
the streams in the islands are mere rivulets, which dry up
for the greater part of the year; and, on the other hand,
the natives are almost amphibious, often spending whole
days in the water, and swimming for hours without fatigue.
Hence it is absurd to imagine that they invented stilts
simply to keep their feet dry at crossing a shallow stream.<a name="FNanchor_46_922" id="FNanchor_46_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_922" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>But perhaps the most popular recreation of the
Marquesans was dancing and singing, which formed a
leading feature of their festivals. Every inhabited district
had its dancing-place, a sort of public square, where places
were set apart for the use of the performers, the musicians,
and the spectators. These have been described by the
missionary, C. S. Stewart, from personal observation. He
says, "Our walk terminated at what may be called the
<i>theatre</i> or <i>opera house</i> of the settlement, a large rectangular
platform of stone pavement, surrounded by low terraces also
laid with stone; the first designed for the public exhibitions
of the song and the dance, and the last for the accommodation
of the spectators who assemble to witness the performance.
Entertainments of this kind are the most
fashionable and favourite amusements at the Washington
and the Marquesan groups. Every inhabited district has its
<i>Tahua</i>, or public square of this kind; some of them so
extensive, it is said, as to be capable of accommodating ten
thousand people."<a name="FNanchor_47_923" id="FNanchor_47_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_923" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Again, speaking of another of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
dancing-places, the same writer observes, "This <i>Tahua</i>, or
theatre, is a structure altogether superior to that visited by
us yesterday, and so massive and well built as to be capable
of enduring for ages. It is a regular oblong square, about
sixty feet in length and forty broad. The outer wall consists
of immense stones, or slabs of rock, three feet high, and
many of them four or six feet long, joined closely together
and hewn with a regularity and neatness truly astonishing, in
view of the rude implements by which it must have been
accomplished. On a level with the top of this outer wall,
a pavement of large flat stones, several feet in width, extends
entirely round, forming seats for the chiefs, warriors, and
other persons of distinction, and singers performing the
recitatives and choruses accompanying the dance. Within
this, and some inches lower, is another pavement still wider,
having large flat-topped stones fixed in it at regular intervals
of six or eight feet, used as seats by the beaters on the
drums, and other rude instruments of music, and immediately
within this again, an unpaved area, some twenty feet long
by twelve broad, constituting the stage on which the dancers
exhibit their skill."<a name="FNanchor_48_924" id="FNanchor_48_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_924" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Some of these dancing-places appear to have been much
larger than those seen by Stewart. According to Langsdorff
they were sometimes not less than a hundred fathoms in
length, and the great smooth pavement consisted of blocks
of stone, several feet broad, laid so neatly and so close
together that you might have imagined it to be the work
of European master-masons.<a name="FNanchor_49_925" id="FNanchor_49_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_925" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Radiguet describes one such
dancing-place as a rectangular area eighty metres (about
two hundred and sixty feet) long by thirty metres (about
one hundred feet) broad, and surrounded by a terrace paved
with stone, on which the spectators were seated.<a name="FNanchor_50_926" id="FNanchor_50_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_926" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The festivals (<i>koikas</i>) celebrated at these places were
either periodical or occasional. Among the periodical
perhaps the most important was that held at the ingathering
of the bread-fruit harvest in February and March.
Among the occasional were those held after a successful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
fishing, at the ratification of peace, and after the death of
a priest or chief, who had been raised to the rank of a deity.
A messenger decked in all the native finery repaired to
the surrounding villages inviting the inhabitants to attend
the festival. Immense numbers of hogs were killed and
huge troughs filled with bread-fruit were provided by the
hosts for the banquet. The festivals were attended not
only by the people of the particular valley in which they
were held, but by the inhabitants of other valleys and even
of other islands; for so long as a festival lasted, a special
taboo forbade the natives to harm the strangers in their
midst. A general truce was observed; members of hostile
tribes came to share the pleasures of the festival with the
foes whom they had recently fought, and whom they would
fight again in a few days.<a name="FNanchor_51_927" id="FNanchor_51_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_927" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Yet such visitors were careful
to observe certain precautions: they never came unarmed,
and they always kept together on one side of the festival
ground, in order that they might rally the more easily for
mutual defence, if they should be suddenly attacked.<a name="FNanchor_52_928" id="FNanchor_52_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_928" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The performers who sang and danced at these festivals
for the entertainment of the public were called <i>Hokis</i> or
<i>Kaioas</i>: they are described as a sort of wandering
troubadours or minstrels, who went from tribe to tribe,
seeking their fortune. They took great care of their persons,
which they artificially whitened. At once poets, musicians,
and dancers, they nevertheless did not enjoy the public
esteem; on the contrary, their effeminate habits incurred
the contempt of a people who had small taste for the fine
arts.<a name="FNanchor_53_929" id="FNanchor_53_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_929" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Thus these wandering minstrels and mountebanks
would seem to have corresponded to the Areois of the
Society Islands.<a name="FNanchor_54_930" id="FNanchor_54_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_930" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The dances were accompanied by the
beating of drums and the songs of a chorus, it might be of
a hundred and fifty singers, who sat on the upper platform
along with the chiefs and warriors. Sometimes in the
intervals between the dances a choir of women, seated on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
an adjoining and elevated platform, would chant in dull
monotonous tones, clapping their hands loudly in unison
with their song. The subjects of the songs were various
and were often furnished by some passing event, such as
the arrival of a ship or any less novel incident. Not
unfrequently, like ballads in our own country, the songs
caught the popular fancy and became fashionable, being
sung in private by all classes of society. So passionately
addicted were the Marquesans to these entertainments that
they undertook the longest and most fatiguing journeys
from all parts of the island in order to be present at them,
carrying their food and suffering great hardships by the
way; they even came in their crazy canoes, at the hazard
of their lives, from other islands, and accepted the risk of
being knocked on the head at one of the brawls with which
such gatherings usually ended.<a name="FNanchor_55_931" id="FNanchor_55_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_931" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Closely connected with the festivals were the banqueting-halls,
as they may be called. These were houses, or rather
sheds, thatched with leaves and open in front, where the
lower end of the sloping roof was supported on short
wooden pillars, of which the upper parts were rudely carved
in the likeness of the god Tiki, thus forming a sort of
Caryatids. These sheds varied in length from thirty to
sixty and even two hundred feet in length. They stood on
quadrangular stone platforms of the usual type, ranging
from three or four to six, eight, twelve, and even fifteen
feet in height. The blocks of stone put together to form
the platforms were sometimes enormous, many of them
measuring eight feet long by four feet thick and wide;
and they were hewn and polished into such perfect form
as to excite the wonder of the European beholder, who
reflected with astonishment on the vast labour requisite to
bring these huge rocks from the sea and to chisel them into
shape without the help of iron tools. Access to the platforms
was afforded by sloping trunks of trees notched into steps.
In these open sheds the men feasted and prayed. Before
each repast it was customary to offer to the deity a small
portion of food wrapt in leaves. Sometimes the priests
would thrust the morsels into the mouths of Tiki's grotesque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
images. No woman might enter these banqueting-halls or
mount the platforms on which they stood. The place was
strictly tabooed to them, and the taboo was signified in the
usual way by long pennants of white cloth attached to the
posts of the house.<a name="FNanchor_56_932" id="FNanchor_56_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_932" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 6. <i>Social Ranks, Taboo</i></h4>

<p>Socially the Marquesans were divided into chiefs or
nobles and commoners; but the chiefs seem to have
possessed very little authority, and to have received few
outward marks of deference and respect. A monarchical
government in any proper sense of the word was unknown.<a name="FNanchor_57_933" id="FNanchor_57_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_933" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
The power of the chiefs, such as it was, rested mainly on
their superior wealth, particularly on their landed property;
for the larger their estates, the greater the number of the
tenants whose services they could command. Hence the
government has been called aristocratic and compared to the
feudal system.<a name="FNanchor_58_934" id="FNanchor_58_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_934" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In a fruitful season the chiefs had a right
to a fourth part of the produce, and in other seasons a share
according to circumstances. Their dignity was hereditary.<a name="FNanchor_59_935" id="FNanchor_59_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_935" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
There was no general government of the archipelago as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
whole. Each island was quite independent of all the rest;
and in every island there were several independent tribes,
which were generally at war with each other.<a name="FNanchor_60_936" id="FNanchor_60_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_936" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>A powerful instrument in the hands of the nobles was
the taboo or <i>tapu</i>, which, though it seems to have been
originally a religious institution,<a name="FNanchor_61_937" id="FNanchor_61_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_937" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> was turned to political and
economic account by the chiefs and priests acting in conjunction.
One of our best authorities on the Marquesans
describes the institution as a tool of despotism for the
gratification of the passions and caprices of such as could
wield it.<a name="FNanchor_62_938" id="FNanchor_62_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_938" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> But this is a somewhat one-sided and imperfect
view to take of its scope. There is no doubt, as other
good authorities on the Marquesans have pointed out,
that in the absence of a strong government which could
maintain order and protect life and property, the taboo to
a great extent served the purposes which in more civilised
society are fulfilled by laws.<a name="FNanchor_63_939" id="FNanchor_63_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_939" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The taboo was a sacred
interdiction, a breach of which was believed of itself to
entail disastrous consequences on the transgressor. The
interdiction might be either public or private. To give
examples of public interdictions, when the quantity of breadfruit,
on which the people depended for their subsistence,
was from any cause seriously diminished in a district, the
chief had the right to impose a taboo on bread-fruit trees
for twenty months, during which no one might gather the
fruit. This close time allowed the trees to recover their
strength and fertility. Similarly, if fish were scarce, the
chief might pronounce a taboo on the neighbouring bay, or
a part of it, in order to allow the fish to multiply undisturbed
and replenish the sea in the neighbourhood of human
habitations. Again, in the prospect of a great festival, a
chief might lay an interdict on pigs for two or three years
in advance, in order that, when the time came, there might
be plenty of pork for the multitude at the banquet.
Similarly, when the paper-mulberry, from which the
Marquesans made their bark-cloth, threatened to give out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the chief might lay the trees under an interdict for five
years, at the end of which the crop was sure to be
magnificent.<a name="FNanchor_64_940" id="FNanchor_64_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_940" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In these and similar cases the taboo was of
public utility by ensuring a proper supply of the necessaries
of life. However, its imposition was not always guided by
rational considerations, and hence it sometimes failed of its
purpose. For example, so long as the bread-fruit was
unripe, almost all kinds of fish were taboo and therefore
might not be eaten, and this interdiction, instead of alleviating,
tended naturally to aggravate the scarcity of food.
The reason for the taboo was a curious superstition that if
any one were to eat fish while the bread-fruit was unripe,
the fruit would fall from the trees.<a name="FNanchor_65_941" id="FNanchor_65_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_941" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>But the taboo also served a useful purpose by ensuring
respect for private property, which is a fundamental condition
of social prosperity. "The priests only," we are told, "can
impose a general taboo, but every individual has a right to
pronounce one upon his own property: this is done by
declaring, if his wish be to preserve a breadfruit, or a cocoa
tree, a house or a plantation, from robbery and destruction,
that the spirit of his father or of some king, or indeed of
any other person, reposes in this tree, or house, which then
bears the name of the person, and nobody ventures to
attack it. If any one is so irreligious as to break through
a taboo, and should be convicted of it, he is called <i>kikino</i>;
and the <i>kikinos</i> are always the first to be devoured by the
enemy, at least they believe it to be so, nor is it impossible
that the priests should so arrange matters as that this really
happens."<a name="FNanchor_66_942" id="FNanchor_66_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_942" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Again, if a man's pig had been stolen, and he
suspected who had done the deed, he would lay a taboo on
the swine or other property of the thief by giving his own
name, or the name of somebody else, to the animals or the
trees or whatever it might be. After that, in the opinion
of the people, the property so named was bewitched or
haunted by the spirit of the person, whether alive or dead,
whose name it bore; and this belief sometimes sufficed to
compel the thief to abandon his possessions and to settle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_67_943" id="FNanchor_67_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_943" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> A wreath of leaves or a strip of white cloth
attached to a house, a canoe, a fruit-tree, or other piece
of property, was the symbol of taboo, and in ordinary
circumstances was enough to protect it.<a name="FNanchor_68_944" id="FNanchor_68_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_944" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>But the taboo was an instrument which could be used
capriciously to thwart, as well as to further, the course of
justice. Thus we read how, under the French government
of the islands, a wife set out for the police-office to complain
of the ill-treatment to which she had been subjected by her
husband. But scarcely had she put her foot outside the
door, when her husband, aware of her intention and determined
to frustrate it, called out after her, "The road from
here to the police-office is your father." On hearing that,
the woman at once stopped short, for under no circumstances
would she dare to trample on the author of her being. On
the contrary, she immediately roasted two little pigs and
carried them to the tomb of her father as an offering to
appease his ghost, which might reasonably be supposed to
fret at the mere thought of being trodden under foot by his own
daughter.<a name="FNanchor_69_945" id="FNanchor_69_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_945" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This instructive example shows how closely the
taboo was associated with the fear and worship of the dead;
by bestowing the name of a dead person on a thing you
rendered the thing inviolate, since thereby you placed it
under the immediate protection of the ghost.</p>

<p>Among the multitude of taboos which were religiously
observed by the Marquesans it is perhaps possible to detect
a trace of totemism. Thus the sting ray fish was taboo to
the tribe of Houmis. Not only would they not eat the fish,
but they fled in horror if it were even shown to them.
Their horror was explained by a tradition that once on a
time a great chief of the tribe had been out fishing with his
people, when a gigantic sting ray upset their canoes and
gobbled them all up.<a name="FNanchor_70_946" id="FNanchor_70_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_946" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This aversion to eating and even
looking at a certain species of animal, together with a
traditionary explanation based on an incident in the past
history of the tribe, is very characteristic of totemism.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 7. <i>Religion and Mythology</i></h4>

<p>The consideration of taboo introduces us to the subject
of religion; for, on the one hand, the foregoing evidence
tends to establish a connexion between the institution of
taboo and the doctrine of the human soul, and on the other
hand some of our best authorities on the Marquesans have
stated that the taboo was believed to be an expression of
the will of the gods conveyed to the people through the
mouth of a priest.<a name="FNanchor_71_947" id="FNanchor_71_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_947" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The definition may be accepted, if
under gods we include the spirits of the dead, who were
worshipped by the Marquesans and lent their sanction, as
we have just seen, to the taboo.</p>

<p>The Marquesan term for a god was the usual Polynesian
word <i>atua</i> or, as it is sometimes spelled, <i>etua</i>. But their
notion of divinity, as commonly happens, was vague. One
of the earliest writers on their religion, the Russian navigator
Krusenstern, informs us that "a confused notion of a higher
being, whom they call <i>Etua</i>, does indeed exist among them,
but of these there are several kinds; the spirit of a priest, of
a king, or of any of his relations, being an <i>etua</i>. They
likewise consider all Europeans as such; for as their ideas
do not extend beyond their own horizon, they are firmly
convinced that their ships come from the clouds; and they
imagine that thunder is occasioned by the cannonading of
vessels which float in the atmosphere, on which account they
entertain a great dread of artillery."<a name="FNanchor_72_948" id="FNanchor_72_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_948" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The <i>atuas</i> or deities
of the Marquesans, we are told by another writer, "are
numerous and vary in their character and powers. Besides
those having dominion respectively, as is supposed, over the
different elements and their most striking phenomena, there
are <i>atuas</i> of the mountain and of the forest, of the sea-side and
of the interior, <i>atuas</i> of peace and of war, of the song and of
the dance, and of all the occupations and amusements of life.
It is supposed by them that many of the departed spirits of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
men also become <i>atuas</i>: and thus the multiplicity of their
gods is such, that almost every sound in nature, from the
roaring of the tempest in the mountains and the bursting
of a thunderbolt in the clouds, to the sighing of a breeze
through the cocoa-nut tops and the chirping of an insect in
the grass or in the thatch of their huts, is interpreted into
the movements of a god."<a name="FNanchor_73_949" id="FNanchor_73_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_949" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>But the Marquesans, not content with deifying some men
after death, deified others in their lifetime. Amongst them
there is, or rather used to be, a class of living men "who
claim the title and attributes of the Deity; not through a
professed inspiration or possession by a supernatural influence
or power, but in their own right of godship as those
who control the elements, impart fruitfulness to the productions
of the earth or smite them with blasting and sterility,
and who exercise the prerogatives of the Deity in scattering
disease and wielding the shafts of death. They are few in
number, not more than one or two at farthest on an island,
and live in a seclusion and mysticism somewhat in unison
with their blasphemous pretensions. There is none at
present in the near vicinity of Taiohae,<a name="FNanchor_74_950" id="FNanchor_74_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_950" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> though the former
abode of such an individual is pointed out at the foot of a
bold cliff, high in the mountains. The Rev. Mr. Crook gives
the following account of an Atua, at the island of Tahuata,
in the Windward or Marquesan group, while he resided there
temporarily in 1797, as a missionary from the London
Missionary Society: 'He is now of great age, and has lived
from early life at Hanateiteina, in a large house surrounded
by an enclosure called the A. In the house is an altar, and
from the beams within and upon the trees around it are
human carcasses, suspended with their heads downward and
scalped. No one enters the premises but his servant, except
when human sacrifices are offered. Of these, more are
offered to him than to any other of their gods, and he
frequently seats himself on an elevated scaffold in front of
his house and calls for two or three at a time. He is invoked
in all parts of the island, and offerings everywhere are made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
to him and sent to Hanateiteina.'"<a name="FNanchor_75_951" id="FNanchor_75_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_951" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Similarly a Catholic
missionary tells us that in the island of Nukahiva he was
personally acquainted with two living human deities, a priest
and a priestess, both of whom, it was said, had the right to
demand the sacrifice of human victims to themselves. He
adds, however, that they did not abuse the right, and that
nobody in the world appeared more affable and polite than
these divinities; he even entertained hopes of one day
baptizing the priest.<a name="FNanchor_76_952" id="FNanchor_76_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_952" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Of the reverence in which the priestly
class in general was held by the people, Captain Porter
remarks that "their priests are their oracles; they are considered
but little inferior to their gods; to some they are
greatly superior, and after their death they rank with the
chief divinity."<a name="FNanchor_77_953" id="FNanchor_77_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_953" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Little seems to be recorded of the theology and mythology
of the Marquesans; but among their myths was the
widespread Polynesian story of the origin of fire. Of old, it
was said, fire used to be jealously guarded by Mahoike in the
infernal regions. Hearing of its utility, Maui descended into
the nether world to steal some of the element; but he failed
to elude the vigilance of its guardian and was obliged to
resort to force to extort the boon from him. In the struggle
which ensued Mahoike lost an arm and a leg, and to save
his remaining limbs he consented to give fire to the victorious
Maui. At the same time he offered to rub it on Maui's leg;
but Maui was too cunning to agree to that, for he knew that
in that case the fire which he took to earth would not be
sacred. Finally, Mahoike rubbed the fire on Maui's head,
and said to him, "Go back to the place you came from and
touch with your forehead all the trees except the <i>ke&iuml;ka</i>: all
the trees will yield you fire."<a name="FNanchor_78_954" id="FNanchor_78_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_954" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>In the Marquesas there was a class of men called <i>tauas</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
who were supposed to possess an hereditary gift of inspiration
and to become deities after their death. They could cause
a god to dwell within them. Often at night they might be
heard conversing with the divinity in their bodies, the deity
crying out in a shrill voice, while the man answered him in
his own ordinary voice. Sometimes they would make a
rustling noise with their fingers in the leaves, and say that
they had been miraculously taken through the thatch of the
house and brought back again by the door. In their fits of
inspiration they became convulsed and glared fiercely with
their eyes; then, with their hands quivering violently, they
would run about, while they prophesied death to their
enemies in squeaky tones, or demanded human victims for
the god by whom they were possessed. With the function
of prophecy they combined the office of physician or rather
of exorciser. For every internal disorder was believed to be
inflicted by some god, who had taken possession of the
sufferer's person; and the <i>tauas</i>, or high priests, as we may
call them, were called in to heal the patient by ridding him
of the divinity who had entered into him. This they
commonly did by feeling for the mischievous deity till
they found him, when they smothered him between the
palms of their hands.<a name="FNanchor_79_955" id="FNanchor_79_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_955" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Sometimes the good physician would
converse with the spirit whom he had thus caught between
his hands, and would elicit from him in conversation the
cause of the sickness, which usually consisted in some breach
of taboo, such as a theft of bread-fruit or coco-nuts from a
sacred tree. At the same time the affable spirit would
reveal to the physician the penalty which the sick man must
pay in order to expiate his crime and thereby ensure his
recovery. A sacrifice of pigs would appear to have been
usually deemed indispensable for the patient's complete
convalescence; the animals were conveyed to a temple and
there consumed by the priests for the benefit of the sufferer.<a name="FNanchor_80_956" id="FNanchor_80_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_956" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
The <i>tauas</i> or high priests were supposed to become gods
after death; when one of them departed this life, it was
essential for his deification that human victims should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
sacrificed. The number of victims varied with the rank of
the new deity; it was never less than seven, but oftener ten.
Each victim was sacrificed for the sake of a particular part of
the deity's body, as for his head, or his eyes, or his hair. To
procure the necessary tale of victims, predatory expeditions
were undertaken against the tribes in neighbouring valleys.<a name="FNanchor_81_957" id="FNanchor_81_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_957" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 8. <i>The Soul, Death, and Funeral Customs</i></h4>

<p>Like most savages, the Marquesans thought that they
possessed souls which could quit their bodies and wander far
away in dreams. Thus a young girl once related how, the
night before, she had sailed in a splendid canoe to Tiburones,
a mythical paradise to the west of Nukahiva; there she had
seen beautiful things such as do not exist here on earth.
"There," said she, "the trees are very tall, and the people
very handsome; there they sing songs to music sweeter than
ours. Ah! when shall I be able to return to Tiburones?"
On another occasion a woman's soul appeared to a priest to
inform him that she had committed the heinous crime of
eating a fowl, but that she would expiate the sacrilege by an
early death. The French authorities summoned both the
priest and the woman to the bar of justice. There the
priest stuck to it that he had received the revelation, and the
woman expressed her regret for the escapade of which her
soul had been guilty without her knowledge. It was
necessary to reassure her on the subject of her soul's
rash act and melancholy prediction, otherwise she might
have fulfilled the prophecy by refusing food and dying
outright.<a name="FNanchor_82_958" id="FNanchor_82_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_958" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>At death the soul was supposed to depart from the
body by the mouth or the nose; hence in order to delay
its departure and so to prolong the life of its owner,
affectionate relatives used to stop his mouth and nostrils,
thus accelerating the event which they wished to retard.<a name="FNanchor_83_959" id="FNanchor_83_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_959" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The Marquesans have, or used to have, a sovereign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
contempt for death, and do not fear its approach. When a
native felt that he must die, he took it calmly and ordered
his coffin, which he caused to be brought to the house while
he was still in life. The coffin is hollowed out of a single
log and resembles a canoe. If the sick man after all
recovered, the coffin was kept in a corner of the house till
it was wanted. No attempt was made to hide it or to
disguise its purpose. Should a stranger ask, "What is
that?" he would be told, "It is So-and-so's coffin"; though
So-and-so might be present and within hearing.<a name="FNanchor_84_960" id="FNanchor_84_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_960" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Nevertheless,
when it was clear that a serious illness was about
to terminate fatally, and that all the efforts of the priestly
physician or sorcerer to avert the inevitable end were fruitless,
the house would be filled by wailing women, who
danced naked round the mat of the dying man, cutting
themselves with sharp stones or shark's teeth as in a
frenzy, and uttering the most piercing lamentations. This
lasted till the moment of death, when all united in a terrific
and prolonged howl.<a name="FNanchor_85_961" id="FNanchor_85_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_961" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Similar demonstrations of sorrow
were continued or renewed after the decease. If the
departed was a married man and his widow survived him,
she would bruise her flesh with a stone, scratch it with her
nails, and cut her forehead, cheeks, and breast with shark's
teeth or splinters of bamboo till the blood trickled down.<a name="FNanchor_86_962" id="FNanchor_86_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_962" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Captain Porter saw a woman with deep wounds still
unhealed, which she had inflicted on her neck, breast, and
arms for the loss of her husband, who had been devoured
by a shark.<a name="FNanchor_87_963" id="FNanchor_87_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_963" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> After the death, too, the widow would place
herself in front of the corpse, and three or four girls would
surround her; whereupon they would all engage in a
lascivious dance, with outstretched arms, tripping in cadence
to the accompaniment of a funeral hymn or lamentation,
which was chanted by a choir in honour of the dead. After
executing the dance, which would seem to have been
intended to attract the attention of the deceased and recall
his wandering spirit, they would stoop over the corpse, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
cry, "He has not stirred! He stirs not. Alas! alas! he
is no more." It was only after they had thus practised
their seductions in vain on the dead man that the widow
gave way to her frantic outburst of sorrow by mauling herself
with a sort of saw.<a name="FNanchor_88_964" id="FNanchor_88_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_964" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> This funeral dance a widow was
apparently expected to renew in public at every festival for
months after the death. At a festival, which he called the
Feast of Calabashes, Melville saw four or five old women,
stark naked, holding themselves erect and leaping stiffly
into the air, with their arms pressed close to their sides,
like sticks bobbing up and down in water. They preserved
the utmost gravity of countenance, and continued
their strange movements without a single moment's cessation,
though they did not appear to attract the observation of the
crowd around them. The American was told that these
dancing or leaping figures "were bereaved widows, whose
partners had been slain in battle many moons previously;
and who, at every festival, gave public evidence in this
manner of their calamities."<a name="FNanchor_89_965" id="FNanchor_89_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_965" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> When the deceased was a
chief, the lamentations and the dances went on day and
night for some time. A priestess or sorceress, in festal
costume, led the choir of female mourners and vaunted the
exploits of the dead warrior, recalling his mighty deeds and
the incidents of his life. The dances were accompanied by
the music of drums. The crowd of spectators, in their best
array, ate and drank to repletion, and, flushed with liquor,
abandoned themselves to excesses which transformed the
mortuary chamber, lit up at night by smoky torches,
into a scene of low debauchery. From time to time
remarks of a gross nature were addressed to the dead
man on the helpless condition to which he was reduced;
and now and then the women would slash their faces and
breasts with splinters of bamboo in the usual fashion. The
orgy went on till the provisions were completely exhausted,
which might not be for a considerable time, since hecatombs
of pigs were sometimes slaughtered for the purpose of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
celebrating the obsequies of a chief in a manner worthy of
his rank.<a name="FNanchor_90_966" id="FNanchor_90_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_966" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The soul of the dead was believed not to abandon the
corpse definitely for two days after the death. In the
interval it was thought to haunt the house, watching the
conduct of the survivors, and ready to act as a friend or a
foe according as the mourners behaved towards the deceased
and his remains. Hence, to keep the ghost in good humour
it was customary to offer him food, in the shape of breadfruit
paste and other dainties, which were wrapped up in
leaves, hung on the edge of the coffin, and frequently
renewed.<a name="FNanchor_91_967" id="FNanchor_91_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_967" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> On the third night after the death a priest,
stepping out on the terrace in front of the house, implored
the wandering soul of the deceased to depart; and by way
of enforcing the request a band of men, armed with spears
and other lethal weapons, went about in the outer darkness,
beating the bushes and stabbing the thatched roofs of the
houses in order to drive the lingering ghost away. If,
roused by the clamour, the dogs began to bark, the priest
would say, "The soul is departing."<a name="FNanchor_92_968" id="FNanchor_92_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_968" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>From the moment of death till the priests had completed
the litany or songs chanted on such occasions, all
the assembled people fasted, no one touched the provisions
collected for the funeral feast, and no fire might be kindled
within sight of the house.<a name="FNanchor_93_969" id="FNanchor_93_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_969" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The litany consisted in the
mumbling of a long speech in an unintelligible language
accompanied by the constant beating of drums.<a name="FNanchor_94_970" id="FNanchor_94_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_970" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Among
the victuals provided for the funeral feast special importance
appears to have been attached to the head of a pig, which
was cut off and attached to the bier.<a name="FNanchor_95_971" id="FNanchor_95_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_971" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> We are told that
the professed intention was thereby "to propitiate the gods,
and obtain for the deceased a safe and peaceable passage
through the lower regions." But, in point of fact the priest
took possession of the pig's head and devoured it secretly,
leaving only a small piece of it under a stone.<a name="FNanchor_96_972" id="FNanchor_96_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_972" class="fnanchor">[96]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>When death had taken place, the body was washed,
neatly dressed in garments of new cloth, and laid on a bier
constructed of bamboos or of spears and other warlike weapons,
fastened together with wicker-work and spread with mats.<a name="FNanchor_97_973" id="FNanchor_97_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_973" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
If the deceased was a chief and a warrior, his body would be
arrayed in his finest ornaments, and his club, plumed helmet,
necklaces of whale's teeth, and skulls of the enemies he had
killed, would be laid beside him. Thus exposed, the corpse
might be kept for weeks in the house, where, in spite of the
stench, the family continued to eat, drink, and sleep beside
it. Sometimes, however, and perhaps more usually, the body
was transferred to a small house or shed adjoining the dwelling
of the deceased, where it received the necessary attentions.
Finally, it was removed to a little hut or shed, where
the bier was supported on posts under a thatched roof. To
be buried in the earth was a mark of ignominy reserved at
most for a young girl of the lowest rank who had died
childless. Beside the corpse food was hung for the use of
the ghost, it might be fish, roast pork, or coco-nuts, and there
it was allowed to remain till it rotted and fell to the ground;
none but children would be greedy or impious enough to
partake of the sacred victuals, and that only in the greatest
secrecy. Often the house in which the death had taken
place was tabooed and abandoned after the remains had been
deposited in their last home.<a name="FNanchor_98_974" id="FNanchor_98_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_974" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The bodies of the dead were regularly subjected to a
kind of embalmment, which had the effect of preserving them
for a longer or shorter time. As soon as decomposition
appeared imminent, the corpse was stripped of its ornaments
and placed in the usual canoe-shaped coffin, the trunk being
propped up so as to facilitate the work of the embalmers.
The task of embalming was entrusted to women, relations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
the deceased, who rubbed the body daily with coco-nut oil
and perfumes. They had no intercourse with the rest of the
family, and took their meals apart without ever washing
their hands. According to one account, the anointment was
performed by night, while during the day the body was
exposed to the sun on the stone platform of the house. The
products of decomposition were carefully received in vessels
and carried away to the place of sepulture; and the corpse
was gradually eviscerated through the rectum. The friction
was continued until the desiccated body was reduced to the
state of a mummy, though sometimes, in spite of all precautions,
it crumbled into dust. If the operation was successful,
the mummy, wrapt in many bandages, was covered
by a second canoe attached to the first, and was then placed
on a scaffold in a <i>morai</i> or sanctuary specially consecrated
to it. But sometimes the mummy was fastened up to the
roof or wall of the house wherein the person had died; and
it might be kept there even for years.  When it was deposited
in a <i>morai</i>, no woman was allowed to approach it under pain
of death.<a name="FNanchor_99_975" id="FNanchor_99_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_975" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Sometimes the head was detached from the body
and kept in the house, where it was treated with respect.
Sometimes it was carried away and hidden in some almost
inaccessible cave in the mountains or beside the sea. This was
done as a precaution to save the skulls from falling into the
hands of enemies, who were eager to bear them off as trophies.<a name="FNanchor_100_976" id="FNanchor_100_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_976" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Each family had its own <i>morai</i> or burial-place, where the
mouldering bones or mummies were finally deposited and
left to decay.<a name="FNanchor_101_977" id="FNanchor_101_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_977" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Such family cemeteries were scattered about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
the valleys; the choice of a site seems to have been determined
by no special rule.<a name="FNanchor_102_978" id="FNanchor_102_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_978" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The <i>morai</i> or burial-place of
ordinary people was near their houses, and not far from it
was a taboo-house, where the men feasted on the flesh of
pigs.<a name="FNanchor_103_979" id="FNanchor_103_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_979" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> But the cemeteries of chiefs were situated in the
interior of the valleys, often so deeply imbedded in dense
foliage that it was not easy to find them without the guidance
of a native.<a name="FNanchor_104_980" id="FNanchor_104_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_980" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Similarly we are told that the cemeteries
(<i>morais</i>) of priests lay quite apart from all dwellings.<a name="FNanchor_105_981" id="FNanchor_105_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_981" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The ordinary form of a Marquesan <i>morai</i> or burial-place
seems to have been a thatched shed erected on a square
or oblong platform of stones, exactly resembling the stone
platforms on which the Marquesan houses were regularly
built. Thus Vincendon-Dumoulin and Desgraz say that
"the <i>morais</i>, funeral monuments where the bodies are deposited,
are erected on a stone platform, the base of all
Nukahivan edifices."<a name="FNanchor_106_982" id="FNanchor_106_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_982" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Again, describing what he calls "a
picturesque <i>morai</i>," Radiguet observes, "Four posts, erected
on a platform, supported a small plank covered with a roof
of leaves. Under this roof could be seen the remains of a
skeleton, perhaps that of the daughter-in-law of the neighbouring
house.... At the two ends of the platform two
upright stones, about ten feet high, and resembling the Breton
<i>menhirs</i>, formed an exceptional ornament to this <i>morai</i>, which
the bushes were in course of invading and the storms of
demolishing."<a name="FNanchor_107_983" id="FNanchor_107_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_983" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Again, Stewart describes as follows what he
calls "a depository of the dead": "It stands in the midst of
a beautiful clump of trees, and consists of a platform of
heavy stone work, twenty feet or more square and four or
five high, surmounted in the centre by eight or ten posts
arranged in the shape of a grave, and supporting at a height
of six or seven feet a long and narrow roof of thatch. Close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
beneath this was the body enclosed in a coffin."<a name="FNanchor_108_984" id="FNanchor_108_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_984" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Again,
in the island of Tahuata (Santa Christina), Bennett describes
a chief's burial-place as follows: "A low but extensive
stone platform, beneath the shade of a venerable <i>fau</i>-tree,
marks the more consecrated ground; and on this is erected
a wooden hut, containing an elevated trough, shaped as a
canoe, and holding the perfect skeleton of the late chief. In
front of the sepulchre are two hideous wooden idols, and
several bundles of coco-nut leaves."<a name="FNanchor_109_985" id="FNanchor_109_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_985" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The shed, which was
erected on the stone platform, and under which the body
rested on a bier, seems to have consisted for the most part
simply of a thatched roof supported on wooden posts.<a name="FNanchor_110_986" id="FNanchor_110_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_986" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Sometimes,
however, instead of a simple shed, open on all sides,
a small house resembling the ordinary houses of the natives
appears to have been erected for the reception of the corpse
or mummy. Thus in the island of Tahuata (Santa Christina)
Bennett describes a burial-place as follows: "The most
picturesque mausoleum we noticed was that which contained
the corpse of one of Eutiti's children. It was placed on the
summit of an isolated hill, rising from the bosom of a well-wooded
savannah, and was covered entirely with the leaves
of the fan-palm. The posterior, or tallest wall, was twelve
feet high, the anterior was low, closed by a mat, and decorated
with six wooden pillars, covered with stained cinnet and
white cloth. Strips of tapa [bark-cloth], fixed to a wand,
fluttered on the roof, to denote that the spot was tabooed;
and for the same purpose, a row of globular stones, each the
size of a football, and whitened with coral lime, occupied
the top of a low but broad stone wall which encircled the
building. The interior contained nothing but the bier on
which the corpse was laid."<a name="FNanchor_111_987" id="FNanchor_111_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_987" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> From the sketch which Bennett
gives of this particular mausoleum, as he calls it, we gather
that the sepulchral hut containing the body was not raised
on a stone platform, but built on the flat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>There seems to be no evidence that the stone platforms
on which the sepulchral sheds or huts of the Marquesans
were erected ever took the shape of stepped or terraced
pyramids like the massive stone pyramids of Tahiti and
Tonga. So far as the mortuary platforms of the Marquesans
are described, they appear to have been quadrangular
piles of stone, with upright sides, not stepped or
terraced. Megalithic monuments in the form of stepped
or terraced pyramids seem to have been very rare in the
Marquesas Islands; indeed, it is doubtful whether they
existed at all. With regard to the island of Tahuata (Santa
Christina), it is positively affirmed by Bennett that none of
the valleys contain "any <i>morais</i> or other buildings devoted
to religious purposes, nor any public idols";<a name="FNanchor_112_988" id="FNanchor_112_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_988" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and by <i>morais</i>
he probably means stepped pyramids like those of Tahiti
and Tonga. However, in the valley of Taipii (Typee), in
Nukahiva, a megalithic monument, built in terraces, was
seen by Melville in 1842. He describes it as follows:</p>

<p>"One day in returning from this spring by a circuitous
path, I came upon a scene which reminded me of Stonehenge
and the architectural labours of the Druids. At the
base of one of the mountains, and surrounded on all sides
by dense groves, a series of vast terraces of stone rises, step
by step, for a considerable distance up the hillside. These
terraces cannot be less than one hundred yards in length
and twenty in width. Their magnitude, however, is less
striking than the immense size of the blocks composing
them. Some of the stones, of an oblong shape, are from
ten to fifteen feet in length, and five or six feet thick.
Their sides are quite smooth, but though square, and of
pretty regular formation, they bear no mark of the chisel.
They are laid together without cement, and here and there
show gaps between. The topmost terrace and the lower
one are somewhat peculiar in their construction. They have
both a quadrangular depression in the centre, leaving the
rest of the terrace elevated several feet above it. In the
intervals of the stones immense trees have taken root, and
their broad boughs, stretching far over and interlacing
together, support a canopy almost impenetrable to the sun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Overgrowing the greater part of them, and climbing from
one to another, is a wilderness of vines, in whose sinewy
embrace many of the stones lie half-hidden, while in some
places a thick growth of bushes entirely covers them. There
is a wild pathway which obliquely crosses two of these terraces,
and so profound is the shade, so dense the vegetation, that
a stranger to the place might pass along it without being
aware of their existence.</p>

<p>"These structures bear every indication of a very high
antiquity, and Kory-Kory, who was my authority in all
matters of scientific research, gave me to understand that
they were coeval with the creation of the world; that the
great gods themselves were the builders; and that they
would endure until time shall be no more. Kory-Kory's
prompt explanation, and his attributing the work to a divine
origin, at once convinced me that neither he nor the rest
of his countrymen knew anything about them."<a name="FNanchor_113_989" id="FNanchor_113_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_989" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Melville
was accordingly disposed to attribute the erection of
these remarkable terraces to an extinct and forgotten
race.<a name="FNanchor_114_990" id="FNanchor_114_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_990" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The hypothesis is all the more probable because
the monument appears to have been entirely abandoned
and unused by the natives during the time when they have
been known to Europeans. But it is doubtful whether the
edifice was a pyramid; all that Melville's somewhat vague
description implies is that it consisted of a series of terraces
built one above the other on the hillside.</p>

<p>According to some accounts the remains of the dead,
instead of being deposited in sheds or huts erected on stone
platforms, were buried in the platforms themselves. Thus,
according to William Crook, the first missionary to the
Marquesans, "they have a <i>morai</i> in each district, where the
dead are buried beneath a pavement of large stones."<a name="FNanchor_115_991" id="FNanchor_115_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_991" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
Similarly, in Nukahiva two or three large quadrangular
platforms (<i>pi-pis</i>), heavily flagged, enclosed with regular
stone walls and almost hidden by the interlacing branches
of enormous trees, were pointed out as burial-places to
Melville, and he was told that the bodies "were deposited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
in rude vaults beneath the flagging, and were suffered to
remain there without being disinterred. Although nothing
could be more strange and gloomy than the aspect of these
places, where the lofty trees threw their dark shadows over
rude blocks of stone, a stranger looking at them would have
discerned none of the ordinary evidences of a place of
sepulture."<a name="FNanchor_116_992" id="FNanchor_116_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_992" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> To the same effect, perhaps, Porter observes
that, "when the flesh is mouldered from the bones, they are,
as I have been informed, carefully cleansed: some are kept
for relics, and some are deposited in the <i>morais</i>."<a name="FNanchor_117_993" id="FNanchor_117_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_993" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Again,
Krusenstern says that twelve months after the death "the
corpse is broken into pieces, and the bones are packed in a
small box made of the wood of the bread-fruit tree, and
carried to the <i>morai</i> or burial place, where no woman is
allowed to approach under pain of death."<a name="FNanchor_118_994" id="FNanchor_118_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_994" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> However, these
statements do not necessarily imply that the bones were
buried under the stones of the platform at the <i>morai</i>.</p>

<p>But whether deposited on biers or buried under the
pavement, the remains of the dead were liable to be carried
off in time of war by foes, who regarded such an exploit as
a great deed of heroism. Hence when an invasion of the
enemy in force was expected, the custom was to remove the
bodies from the <i>morai</i> and bury them elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_119_995" id="FNanchor_119_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_995" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The
heads of enemies killed in battle were invariably kept
and hung up as trophies of victory in the house of the
conqueror. They seem to have been smoked in order
to preserve them better.<a name="FNanchor_120_996" id="FNanchor_120_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_996" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> It is said that they were used as
cups to drink kava out of.<a name="FNanchor_121_997" id="FNanchor_121_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_997" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>After ten months or a year the obsequies were concluded
by another funeral feast, which might last from
eight to thirty days according to the rank of the deceased
and the opulence of his family. At the same time offerings
of food were presented afresh at the tomb, and the decorations
were renewed, consisting of branches and leaves and strips
of white bark-cloth, which waved like flags at the end of
little white wands. At these anniversary feasts, to which,
if the deceased was a man of quality, only chiefs were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
many cases admitted, great quantities of pigs were consumed.<a name="FNanchor_122_998" id="FNanchor_122_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_998" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
The intention of the feast is said to have been to thank the
gods for having permitted the dead person to arrive safely
in the other world.<a name="FNanchor_123_999" id="FNanchor_123_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_999" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 9. <i>Fate of the Soul after Death</i></h4>

<p>The souls of the dead were supposed to depart either
to an upper or to a lower world, either to heaven or to a
subterranean region called Havaiki. The particular destination
of a soul after death was determined, not by moral
considerations, not by the virtue or vice of the deceased,
but by the rank he had occupied in this life: people of
quality went to the upper world, and common people went
to the lower, to Havaiki.<a name="FNanchor_124_1000" id="FNanchor_124_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_1000" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> According to a more precise
account, heaven was inhabited by deities of the highest
order, by women who had died in childbed, by warriors who
had fallen on the field of battle, by suicides, and especially
by the aristocratic class of the chiefs. This celestial region
was supposed to be a happy land, abounding in bread-fruit
paste (<i>popoi</i>), pork, and fish, and offering the companionship
of the most beautiful women imaginable. There the bread-fruit
trees dropped their ripe fruit every moment to the
ground, and the supply of coco-nuts and bananas never
failed. There the souls reposed on mats much finer than
those of Nukahiva; and every day they bathed in rivers of
coco-nut oil. In that happy land there were plenty of
plumes and feathers, and boars'-tusks, and sperm-whale
teeth far better than even white men can boast of. The
nether world, on the other hand, was peopled with deities
of the second class and by ordinary human beings, who
had no pretensions to gentility. But it was not a place of
misery much less of punishment or torture; on the contrary,
we are told that both the upper and the lower regions were
happier than the earth which the living inhabit.<a name="FNanchor_125_1001" id="FNanchor_125_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_1001" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The
approach to the lower world, curiously enough, was by
sea. The soul sailed away in a coffin shaped like a canoe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
(<i>pahaa</i>). When it came near the channel which divides
the island Tahuata from the island Hivaoa, it was met by
two deities or two opposing influences, one of which tried
to push the soul into a narrow strait between Tahuata and
a certain rock in the sea, while the other deity or influence
endeavoured to contrive that the soul should keep the broad
channel between the rock and Hivaoa. The souls that
were thrust into the narrow strait were killed; whereas such
as kept the open channel were conducted safe by a merciful
god to their destination.<a name="FNanchor_126_1002" id="FNanchor_126_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_1002" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the land of the dead was identified with
a happy island or islands called Tiburones lying somewhere
in the ocean to the west of Nukahiva. Not uncommonly
natives of the Marquesas sailed away in great double canoes
to seek and find these happy isles, but were never heard of
again. On one occasion, for example, forty men in the
island of Ua-pu, who had revolted against their chief and
been defeated, embarked secretly by night and put to sea,
hoping to discover the Fortunate Islands, where they would
be beyond the reach of their offended lord, and where they
might pass the remainder of their days in liberty and bliss.
What became of them is unknown, for they were seen and
heard of no more in their native island.<a name="FNanchor_127_1003" id="FNanchor_127_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_1003" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>But even the souls that went to heaven were supposed
to stand in need of a canoe in order to reach the place of
bliss. On this point Porter writes: "I endeavoured to
ascertain whether they had an idea of a future state of
rewards and punishments, and the nature of their heaven.
As respects the latter article, they believed it to be an island,
somewhere in the sky, abounding with everything desirable;
that those killed in war and carried off by their friends, go
there, provided they are furnished with a canoe and
provisions; but that those who are carried off by the
enemy, never reach it, unless a sufficient number of the
enemy can be obtained to paddle his canoe there. For
this reason they were so anxious to procure a crew for their
priest, who was killed and carried off by the Happahs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
They have neither rewards nor punishments in this world,
and I could not learn that they expected any in the next."<a name="FNanchor_128_1004" id="FNanchor_128_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_1004" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>In the valley of Taipii (Typee), in the island of
Nukahiva, Captain Porter visited "the chief place of
religious ceremony." It was a platform of the usual sort
situated in a fine grove at the foot of a steep mountain.
On the platform was an idol of hard stone, rudely representing
a deity in human shape of about life size and in a
squatting posture. Arranged on either side of this idol, as well
as in front and rear, were several other images of about the
same size and of the same model, but better carved out of
bread-fruit wood. The place was decorated with streamers
of white cloth. A few paces from the grave were four
fine war canoes, furnished with outriggers, and decorated
with human hair, coral shells, and many white streamers.
In the stern of each canoe was the effigy of a man with a
paddle, steering, in full dress, decked with plumes, ear-rings,
and all the usual ornaments. On enquiring of the natives,
Captain Porter was informed that the dignified effigy seated
in the stern of the most splendid canoe represented a priest
who had been killed not long before by their enemies the
Happahs. In the bottom of the priest's canoe Captain
Porter found the putrefying bodies of two Taipiis (Typees)
whom he and his men had recently killed in battle; and
lying about the canoe he saw many other human carcasses,
with the flesh still on them. The other canoes, he was told,
belonged to different warriors who had been killed or had
died not long since. "I asked them," continues Captain
Porter, "why they had placed their effigies in the canoes,
and also why they put the bodies of the dead Typees in
that of the priest? They told me (as Wilson interpreted) that
they were going to heaven, and that it was impossible to
get there without canoes. The canoe of the priest being
large, he was unable to manage it himself, nor was it right
that he should, he being now a god. They had, therefore,
placed in it the bodies of the Happas and Typees, which had
been killed since his death, to paddle him to the place of
his destination; but he had not been able yet to start, for
the want of a full crew, as it would require ten to paddle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
her, and as yet they had only procured eight. They told
me also that the taboo, laid in consequence of his death,
would continue until he had started on his voyage, which he
would not be able to do until they had killed two more
of their enemies, and by this means completed the crew.
I inquired if he took any sea stock with him. They told
me he did, and pointing to some red hogs in an enclosure,
said that they were intended for him, as well as a quantity
of bread-fruit, coco-nuts, etc., which would be collected from
the trees in the grove. I inquired if he had far to go;
they replied, no: and pointing to a small square stone
enclosure, informed me that was their heaven, that he was
to go there. This place was tabooed, they told me, for
every one except their priests."<a name="FNanchor_129_1005" id="FNanchor_129_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_1005" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>But it was deemed necessary to provide a dead priest or
chief with human victims for other purposes than to paddle
his canoe to heaven. When a great chief died, two
commoners were sometimes sacrificed for the purpose of
escorting him to the abode of bliss; one of them carried
the chief's girdle, and the other bore the head of the pig
that had been slaughtered for the funeral feast. The head
was intended as a present to the warden of the infernal
regions, who, if he did not get this perquisite, would revile
and stone the ghost, and shut the door in his face.<a name="FNanchor_130_1006" id="FNanchor_130_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_1006" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The
number of human victims sacrificed at the death of a priest
varied with the respect and fear which he had inspired in
his lifetime;<a name="FNanchor_131_1007" id="FNanchor_131_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_1007" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> a common number seems to have been three.<a name="FNanchor_132_1008" id="FNanchor_132_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_1008" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The runaway English sailor, Roberts, who had long
resided in the islands, assured the Russian explorer Lisiansky
"that, on the death of a priest, three men must be sacrificed;
two of whom are hung up in the burying-ground, while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
third is cut to pieces, and eaten by visitors; all but the head,
which is placed upon one of the idols. When the flesh of
the first two are wasted away, the bones that remain are
burnt. The custom of the country requires, that the men
destined for sacrifice should belong to some neighbouring
nation, and accordingly they are generally stolen. This
occasions a war of six, and sometimes of twelve, months:
its duration, however, depends upon the nearest relation of
the deceased priest; who, as soon as he is acquainted with
his death, retires to a place of taboo; and till he chooses to
come out, the blood of the two parties does not cease to
flow. During his retirement, he is furnished with everything
he may require, human flesh not excepted."<a name="FNanchor_133_1009" id="FNanchor_133_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_1009" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>A curious mode of preparing a dead man to appear to
advantage before the gods in the other world was to flay
his corpse. A Catholic missionary tells us that when a
dead body began to swell up, in consequence of internal
putrefaction, it was customary to flay it and to preserve the
skin as a precious relic in the family treasury, where the eye
of a profane stranger could never fall on it.<a name="FNanchor_134_1010" id="FNanchor_134_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_1010" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The reason
for observing the custom is not mentioned by this missionary,
but it is explained by another missionary, Father Amable.
It happened that the king or head chief of the island of
Tahuata died, and that his body was brought to the house of
the queen on the bay where Father Amable resided. For
thirty days she kept the corpse in the house and occupied
herself with skinning it with her fingers. Questioned by
the missionary as to her reasons for this strange procedure,
she answered that her husband's body must be without spot
or stain, in order that the great goddess Upu might give
him leave to dwell in her land and to bathe in her lake.
For this deity rules over a sort of submarine Eden, planted
with all sorts of excellent fruits and beautified by the calm
waters of an azure lake. The natives of Tahuata believe
that the souls of all who die in the archipelago assemble on
the top of a high mountain called Kiukiu. When a great
multitude of souls is there gathered together, the sea opens
and the souls fall plump down into the paradise of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
goddess Upu. However, not all of them are permitted to
enter the happy land and to enjoy the pleasures which it
offers. Only such are admitted as have owned in their lifetime
many servants and many pigs and have not been
wicked. Further, none may enter in who bear on their
body any marks of tattooing.<a name="FNanchor_135_1011" id="FNanchor_135_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_1011" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Hence the reason for flaying
dead bodies seems to have been to efface, by removing
the skin, the tattooed marks which would have acted as a
fatal bar to the entrance of the ghost into paradise. As to
the souls of slaves and the poor, in the opinion of the natives
of Tahuata they go to a gloomy land, which is never illumined
by the sun, and where there is nothing but muddy
water to drink.<a name="FNanchor_136_1012" id="FNanchor_136_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_1012" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Nevertheless the people would seem to
have believed that the souls of the dead lingered for a time
beside their mouldering bodies before they took their departure
for the far country. In this belief they sacrificed to
them pigs, some baked, and some alive. The baked pigs
they put in a hollow log and hung from the roof of the hut,
and they said that a god named Mapuhanui, who in the
beginning had bestowed pigs on men, used to come and
feast on the carcasses in company with the ghost. But when
they offered live pigs, they tethered the animals to the hut
in which the dead body lay, and they fed them till the flesh
dropped from the skeleton; after that they allowed the pigs
to die of hunger.<a name="FNanchor_137_1013" id="FNanchor_137_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_1013" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Perhaps, like some other peoples, they
imagined that the ghost hovered about his remains so long
as the flesh adhered to the bones, but that when even that
faint semblance of life had vanished he went away and had
no further occasion for pigs, whether alive or dead.</p>

<p>However, the souls of the dead were not supposed to be
permanently confined to the other world. After a long sojourn
in it, all alike, whatever the region they inhabited in their disembodied
state, could return to earth and be born again.<a name="FNanchor_138_1014" id="FNanchor_138_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_1014" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
Indeed, according to the natives of Nukahiva, the interval
between death and reincarnation was not unduly long; for
"every one here is persuaded, that the soul of a grandfather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
is transmitted by Nature into the body of his grandchildren;
and that, if an unfruitful wife were to place herself under the
corpse of her deceased grandfather, she would be sure to
become pregnant."<a name="FNanchor_139_1015" id="FNanchor_139_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_1015" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Occasionally the soul of a dead person
might even inhabit the body of an animal. Once when a
whale was stranded on one of the islands, a priestess declared
that it was the soul of a certain priest, which would wander
until eight human victims were sacrificed to the gods. In
vain her son would have substituted turtles for human beings;
the people would not hear of it; the prescribed victims
were captured from a neighbouring tribe and put to death
in order to lay the ghost of the whale, or rather of the priest
who had animated the whale's body.<a name="FNanchor_140_1016" id="FNanchor_140_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_1016" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>But the souls of the dead were also believed to return
from the spirit land for other purposes than to be born
again in the flesh. They might come as ghosts to haunt
and torment the living, and as such they were greatly
dreaded by the people.<a name="FNanchor_141_1017" id="FNanchor_141_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_1017" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The first watch of the night was
the hour when they were supposed especially to come on
errands of mischief.<a name="FNanchor_142_1018" id="FNanchor_142_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_1018" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Particularly dreaded were the ghosts of
high priests and great chiefs, who retained in their spiritual
form the passions and the rancours which they had nursed
in life, and who returned in ghostly shape to earth to meddle
with the affairs of the living, and to punish even trivial
offences. To guard against these dangerous intrusions, the
intervention of a priest or priestess was deemed indispensable;
it was his or her business to counteract a spell cast on a
family, or to heal a sickness inflicted on an individual by
one of these ghostly vagrants.<a name="FNanchor_143_1019" id="FNanchor_143_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_1019" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Such was the fear of
wandering ghosts that no Marquesan would dare to stir a
step abroad at night without the light of a torch; for well
he knew that evil spirits lurked beside the path to knock
down and throttle any rash wayfarer who should dare
to leave his footsteps unillumined.<a name="FNanchor_144_1020" id="FNanchor_144_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_1020" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Indeed, we are told
that, of all beliefs in the minds of the natives, the
belief in ghosts was the most deeply rooted. It is impossible
to express the dread which they felt of spectres and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
apparitions; nobody was exempt from it. But it was
only at night that these phantoms were to be feared.
Though they remained invisible, they revealed themselves
to the terror-stricken wanderer by sound and touch; the
least noise heard in the darkness disclosed their presence;
the least contact with them was a sentence of death, sudden
or slow, but sure. Hence, if a man was obliged to go out
after sunset, he would always take somebody with him to
bear him company, even if he had to wake a comrade for
the purpose. Among the women the fear of ghosts was yet
greater, many of them would not stir abroad on a moonless
night even in company. In passing by a burial-ground or
a solitary tomb, people used to throw food towards it for
the purpose of appeasing the ghost, who otherwise would
have attacked them.<a name="FNanchor_145_1021" id="FNanchor_145_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_1021" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>This deep-seated fear of the dead has survived the
conversion, real or nominal, of the Marquesans to Christianity.
No native would even now venture into a cave where the
remains of the dead have been deposited, not though the
greatest treasures were to be found there, for such spots are
believed to be constantly haunted by the ghosts of the
departed. Nobody, it is said, would live in a house in
which somebody has died; every such dwelling is immediately
burnt down. Hence, when a person is grievously sick, a
little primitive hut is erected beside the house, and he is
carried out to die in it, and when he is dead, the hut is in
like manner destroyed with fire.<a name="FNanchor_146_1022" id="FNanchor_146_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_1022" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> A woman will sometimes
commit suicide in order that her ghost may haunt and
torment her unfaithful husband.<a name="FNanchor_147_1023" id="FNanchor_147_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_1023" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, ghosts in the olden time had also
their utility, for they could be summoned up by a priest or
priestess to give information on various subjects, such as the
issue of an illness. On these occasions the wizard would
hold a conversation with the spirit, whose voice could be
heard by the listeners, though his or her shape, as usual,
was invisible in the darkness. Sceptics thought that such
communications were made by means of ventriloquism, and
indeed a priestess, who had professed to evoke the soul of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
dead chieftainess, solemnly maintained that she could make
the voice of anybody, whether dead or alive, to speak
from her stomach.<a name="FNanchor_148_1024" id="FNanchor_148_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_1024" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>In such beliefs and customs are contained as in germ
the whole theory and practice of the worship of the dead.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;We possess no thorough account of the native Marquesan
society and religion as these existed before they were transformed by
European influence. Some of the writers who have described the
islanders and their customs spent only a few days or at most a few
weeks among them. Captain Cook was at the Marquesas only five
days, from the 6th to the 11th of April 1774.<a name="FNanchor_149_1025" id="FNanchor_149_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_1025" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The French explorer
Marchand spent eight days in the islands from the 13th to the 21st
of June 1791.<a name="FNanchor_150_1026" id="FNanchor_150_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_1026" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The Russian explorers Krusenstern and Lisiansky
were with their two ships, the <i>Nadeshda</i> and <i>Neva</i>, at Nukahiva for
ten days, from the 7th to the 17th of May 1804; along with them was
the naturalist Langsdorff, who wrote an independent account of the
voyage.<a name="FNanchor_151_1027" id="FNanchor_151_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_1027" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> But though their stay was short, they had the advantage of
meeting with two Europeans, an Englishman named E. Roberts, and
a Frenchman named Jean (or Joseph) Baptiste Cabri, who had lived
long in the islands and spoke the native language. These men acted
as interpreters to the Russians and supplied them with most of the
information which they give in their books concerning the customs and
beliefs of the Marquesans. Roberts told them that he had been seven
years in Nukahiva and two years previously in Santa Christina (Tau-ata);
that he had been put ashore on the latter island out of an English
merchant ship, the crew of which had mutinied against their captain
and could not prevail upon him to join their party; and that in
Nukahiva he had lately married a relation of the king's, by which he
acquired great consideration, so that it would be easy for him to be of
assistance to them. At the same time he earnestly warned them against
the Frenchman, who had also resided for some years in Nukahiva, but
whose character he painted in very dark colours. The two Russian
captains, Krusenstern and Lisiansky, accordingly put their trust in
Roberts and drew most of their information concerning the natives
from him. On the other hand their naturalist, Langsdorff, made most
use of the Frenchman. He admitted, indeed, that the Englishman
was a man of better character, greater natural intelligence, and much
higher education; but on the other hand he tells us that the Frenchman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>had been longer in the island and possessed a more thorough mastery
of the language and a greater intimacy with the natives, among whom
he had lived as a savage among savages so long that he had almost
forgotten his own native tongue. But Langsdorff took care to question
both these men and only accepted as true statements in which they
agreed with each other, and to this agreement he naturally attached
the greater weight because his two informants were bitterly hostile to
each other and therefore were unlikely to unite in deceiving him.<a name="FNanchor_152_1028" id="FNanchor_152_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_1028" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> On
the whole, then, the account which Langsdorff gives of Marquesan
society and religion is perhaps more trustworthy as well as fuller than
that of his two compatriots and companions, Krusenstern and Lisiansky.</p>

<p>Captain David Porter of the United States Navy was with his ship
the <i>Essex</i> at Nukahiva from October 24th till December 9th, 1813.<a name="FNanchor_153_1029" id="FNanchor_153_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_1029" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
A great part of his time was spent on shore and in close contact with
the natives, and though he did not learn the language, he was able to
employ as an interpreter an Englishman named Wilson, who had lived
for many years in the islands, spoke the language of the natives with
the same facility as his own, and had become a Marquesan in every
respect except in colour. He proved indispensable to the American as
an organ of communication with the people; and much of the information
which Porter gives concerning the customs of the Marquesans was
derived by him from this man.<a name="FNanchor_154_1030" id="FNanchor_154_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_1030" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The American naval chaplain, the Rev. C. S. Stewart, paid about
a fortnight's visit to Nukahiva, from July 27th to August 13th, 1829,
while his ship, the <i>Vincennes</i>, was anchored at the island. But he
received much information from the Rev. W. P. Crook, who spent
nearly two years (1797 and 1798) in the Marquesas, having been the
first missionary landed in the islands by the missionary ship <i>Duff</i>.
During his residence in the islands Mr. Crook kept a journal, which he
allowed Mr. Stewart to consult. The contents of the journal corroborated
Mr. Stewart's own observations as to the inhabitants, and the account
which he gives of the religion of the islanders is based mainly on the
information derived from Mr. Crook<a name="FNanchor_155_1031" id="FNanchor_155_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_1031" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and is therefore valuable; for at
the time when Mr. Crook landed in the Marquesas the customs and
beliefs of the islanders were still practically unaffected by contact with
Europeans.</p>

<p>The surgeon F. D. Bennett, on a whaling voyage spent a few days
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>in Santa Christina (Tau-ata), from February 28th to March 4th, 1835;
and his descriptions of what he saw are good so far as they go; but
naturally he could collect but little accurate information as to the habits
and ideas of the people in so short a time.<a name="FNanchor_156_1032" id="FNanchor_156_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_1032" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>One of the early Catholic missionaries to the Marquesas, Father
Mathias G&mdash;&mdash;, spent two years in the islands and has given us, in a
series of letters, an account of the native customs and beliefs, which,
though far from complete or systematic, is based on personal
observation and is among the best that we possess.<a name="FNanchor_157_1033" id="FNanchor_157_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_1033" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>Hermann Melville lived among the Taipiis (Typees) in Nukahiva
for more than four months,<a name="FNanchor_158_1034" id="FNanchor_158_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_1034" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and wrote a lively narrative of his
experiences. His personal observations are valuable, but as he did
not master the native language, he was not able to throw much light
on the inner life of the people, and in particular on their religious ideas.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May, 1842, the Marquesas Islands were taken
possession of for France by the French Admiral, Du Petit-Thouars;<a name="FNanchor_159_1035" id="FNanchor_159_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_1035" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
and next year, to satisfy the interest of the French public in their new
possession, a comprehensive work on the islands and their inhabitants
was published by MM. Vincendon-Dumoulin et C. Desgraz.<a name="FNanchor_160_1036" id="FNanchor_160_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_1036" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The
authors had visited the islands with the expedition of the French
navigator, J. Dumont d'Urville, in his ships the <i>Astrolabe</i> and the
<i>Z&eacute;l&eacute;e</i>. But as the expedition stayed only about a week at Nukahiva,
from August 26th to September 3rd, 1838,<a name="FNanchor_161_1037" id="FNanchor_161_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_1037" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> the writers had little
opportunity of making personal observations. Their work is mainly
a careful compilation from earlier sources, and as such it is a useful
and trustworthy summary of what was known about the archipelago
and its inhabitants down to the date of publication.</p>

<p>Max Radiguet, one of the members of the expedition to the
Marquesas under Admiral Du Petit-Thouars, passed a considerable
time in the islands and wrote a graphic account of his experiences,
which contains some valuable information as to the natives, their
customs, religion, and mythology.<a name="FNanchor_162_1038" id="FNanchor_162_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_1038" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> In the part which concerns the
mythology he was assisted by an officer of artillery, M. Rohr, who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>lived for several years in Nukahiva and was familiar with the language
and customs of the people.<a name="FNanchor_163_1039" id="FNanchor_163_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_1039" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>In 1877 a good general account of the archipelago and its
inhabitants was published at Paris. The author was a naval lieutenant,
P. E. Eyriaud des Vergnes, who having lived in the islands in the
official capacity of Resident for about six years (from 1868 to 1874)
had ample time and opportunity for obtaining accurate information on
the subject.<a name="FNanchor_164_1040" id="FNanchor_164_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_1040" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> His work, though somewhat slight, is valuable so far as
it goes; but it does not tell us much about the native religion, which
in his time had probably lost a good deal of its original character
through the influence of the missionaries and of civilisation.<a name="FNanchor_165_1041" id="FNanchor_165_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_1041" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Some years later, in 1881 and 1882, a French naval doctor, Clavel
by name, passed six months in the Marquesas. During his stay he made
personal observations and collected information on the natives. These
he subsequently published in a little work, which contains much of
value;<a name="FNanchor_166_1042" id="FNanchor_166_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_1042" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> but when he wrote almost all the natives had been nominally
converted to Christianity and their ancient religion was practically
extinct.<a name="FNanchor_167_1043" id="FNanchor_167_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_1043" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of the nineteenth century the German traveller
Arthur Baessler paid a short visit to the Marquesas. In his book of
travel in the South Sea he has given us descriptions of the islands and
the people as he saw them, including some account of the scanty remains
of their stone monuments and images.<a name="FNanchor_168_1044" id="FNanchor_168_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_1044" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p></div>

who gives the dimensions of some of
the blocks of stone composing the platforms
and expresses his amazement at
the labour involved in their construction.
He concludes his description as
follows (ii. 39): "When we count
the immense numbers of such places,
which are everywhere to be met with,
our astonishment is raised to the highest,
that a people in a state of nature, unassisted
by any of those artificial means,
which so much assist and facilitate
the labour of the civilized man, could
have conceived and executed a work,
which, to every beholder, must appear
stupendous. These piles are raised
with views to magnificence alone; there
does not appear to be the slightest
utility attending them: the houses
situated on them are unoccupied,
except during the period of feasting,
and they appear to belong to a public,
without the whole efforts of which
they could not have been raised, and
with every exertion that could possibly
have been made, years must have been
requisite for the completion of them."
Of one of these structures seen by him
in the anterior of Nukahiva, Stewart
observes, "The stones, bearing marks
of antiquity that threw the air of an
old family mansion around the whole,
were regularly hewn and joined with
the greatest nicety, many which I
measured being from four to six feet in
length, nearly as wide, and two or
more deep" (<i>Visit to the South Seas</i>,
i. 267 <i>sq.</i>).</p></div>

<h3>THE BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY AMONG THE HAWAIIANS</h3>


<h4>&sect; 1. <i>The Sandwich or Hawaiian Islands</i></h4>

<p>The Sandwich or Hawaiian Islands form an archipelago
lying in the North Pacific Ocean just within the northern
tropic. They stretch in a direction from north-west to
south-east for more than four hundred miles and include
eight inhabited islands, of which the most important are
Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, and Kauai. Of these Hawaii is by
far the largest; indeed it is the largest island in Polynesia
with the exception of New Zealand. The islands are all
mountainous and of volcanic formation. In Hawaii two of
the mountains are between 13,000 and 14,000 feet in height,
and two of them are active volcanoes; one of them,
named Kilauea, possesses the greatest active crater in the
world, a huge cauldron of seething lava, which presents a
spectacle of awe-inspiring grandeur when seen on a moonless
night. The other and much loftier volcano, Mauna Loa,
was the scene of a terrific eruption in 1877 and of another
in 1881. Craters, large and small, hot springs, and other
evidences of volcanic activity, abound throughout the
archipelago. One of the craters on the island of Maui is
said to be no less than fifteen miles in circumference and
about two thousand feet deep. The islands appear to have
been known to the Spaniards as early as the sixteenth
century; but they were rediscovered in 1778 by Captain
Cook, who was afterwards killed in a fight with the natives
in Hawaii.<a name="FNanchor_1_1045" id="FNanchor_1_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1045" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>Viewed from the sea the islands are apt to present an
appearance of barrenness and desolation. The mountains
descend into the sea in precipices often hundreds of feet
high: their summits are capped with snow or lost in mist
and clouds; and their sides, green and studded with clumps
of trees in some places, but black, scorched and bare in
others, are rent into ravines, down which in the rainy seasons
cataracts rush roaring to the sea. With the changes of
sunshine and shadow the landscape as a whole strikes the
beholder now as in the highest degree horrid, dismal, and
dreary, now as wildly beautiful and romantic with a sort of
stern and sombre magnificence.<a name="FNanchor_2_1046" id="FNanchor_2_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1046" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Inland, however, in many
places the summits of the ridges crowned with forests of
perpetual verdure, the slopes covered with flowering shrubs
or lofty trees, the rocks mantled in creepers, the waterfalls
dropping from stupendous cliffs, and the distant prospects
of snowy peaks, bold romantic headlands, and blue seas, all
arched by a summer sky of the deepest azure, combine to
make up pictures of fairy-like and enchanting loveliness.<a name="FNanchor_3_1047" id="FNanchor_3_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1047" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The climate naturally varies with the height above the
sea. On the coasts, though warm, it is remarkably equable,
and perhaps no country in the world enjoys a finer or
healthier climate than some parts of Hawaii and Maui.
On the mountains all varieties of climate are to be found,
from the tropical heat of the lowlands to the arctic cold of
the two great peaks of Hawaii, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa
with their perpetual snows, which are not, however, always
visible from the sea or from the foot of these giants. In the
lowlands frost is unknown. The fresh breezes, which blow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
from the sea during the day and from the mountains at night,
temper the heat of the sun, and render the evenings delicious;
nothing can surpass the splendour and clearness of the
moonlight. Rain falls more abundantly on the windward
or eastern side of the islands than on the leeward or
western side. Thus at Hilo, on the eastern side of Hawaii,
it rains almost every day, whereas in Kena, on the western
side, rain hardly ever falls, and along the coast not a single
water-course is to be seen for many miles. In general
it may be said that the archipelago suffers from drought
and hence occasionally from dearth.<a name="FNanchor_4_1048" id="FNanchor_4_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1048" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 2. <i>The Natives and their Mode of Life</i></h4>

<p>The natives of the Sandwich Islands are typical
Polynesians. In general they are rather above the
middle stature, well formed, with fine muscular limbs,
open countenances, and features frequently resembling
those of Europeans. The forehead is usually well developed,
the lips thick, and the nostrils full, without any flatness or
spreading of the nose. The complexion is tawny or olive
in hue, but sometimes reddish brown. The hair is black
or brown and occasionally fair or rather ruddy in colour,
in texture it is strong, smooth, and sometimes curly. The
gait is graceful and even stately. But in these islands,
as in other parts of Polynesia, there is a conspicuous
difference between the chiefs and the commoners, the
superiority being altogether on the side of the chiefs. "The
nobles of the land," says Stewart, "are so strongly marked
by their external appearance, as at all times to be easily
distinguishable from the common people. They seem,
indeed, in size and stature to be almost a distinct race.
They are all large in their frame, and often excessively
corpulent, while the common people are scarce of the
ordinary height of Europeans, and of a thin rather than full
habit."<a name="FNanchor_5_1049" id="FNanchor_5_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1049" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And the difference between the two ranks is as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
obvious in their walk and general deportment as in their
stature and size, the nobles bearing themselves with a
natural dignity and grace which are wanting in their social
inferiors. Yet there seems to be no reason to suppose that
they belong to a different race from the commoners; the
greater care taken of them in childhood, their better living,
sexual selection, and the influence of heredity appear
sufficient to account for their physical superiority. The
women are well built and "beautiful as ancient statues"
with a sweet and engaging expression of countenance. Yet
on the whole the Hawaiians are judged to be physically
inferior both to the Tahitians and to the Marquesans;
according to Captain King, they are rather darker than the
Tahitians, and not altogether so handsome a people. On
the other hand they are said to be more intelligent than
either the Tahitians or the Marquesans. Captain King
describes them as of a mild and affectionate disposition,
equally remote from the extreme levity and fickleness of
the Tahitians, and from the distant gravity and reserve
of the Tongans.<a name="FNanchor_6_1050" id="FNanchor_6_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1050" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> They practised tattooing much less than
many other Polynesians, but their faces, hands, arms, and
the forepart of their bodies were often tattooed with a
variety of patterns.<a name="FNanchor_7_1051" id="FNanchor_7_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1051" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The staple food of the Hawaiians consists of taro (<i>kalo</i>),
sweet potatoes, and fish, but above all of taro. That root
(<i>Arum</i> or <i>Caladium esculentum</i>) is to the Hawaiians what
bread-fruit is to the Tahitians, and its cultivation is their
most important agricultural industry. It is grown wherever
there is water or a marsh, and it is even planted on some
arid heights in the island of Hawaii, where it yields
excellent crops. Artificial irrigation was practised and
even regulated by law or custom in the old days; for it
was a rule that water should be conducted over every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
plantation twice a week in general, and once a week during
the dry season. The bread-fruit tree is not so common,
and its fruit not so much prized, as in the Marquesas and
Tahiti. The natives grew sweet potatoes even before the
arrival of Europeans. Yams are found wild, but are hardly
eaten except in times of scarcity. There are several sorts
of bananas; the fruit for the most part is better cooked
than raw. In the old days the cooking was done in
the ordinary native ovens, consisting of holes in the
ground lined with stones which were heated with fire.
After being baked in an oven the roots of the taro are
mashed and diluted with water so as to form a paste or
pudding called <i>poe</i> or <i>poi</i>, which is sometimes eaten sweet
but is more generally put aside till it has fermented, in
which condition it is preferred by the natives. It is a
highly nutritious substance, and though some Europeans
complain of the sourness of taro pudding, others find it not
unpalatable. Fish used to be generally eaten raw, seasoned
with brine or sea-water. But they also commonly salt their
fish, not for the sake of preserving it for a season of scarcity,
but because they prefer the taste. They construct artificial
fish-ponds, into which they let young fish from the sea,
principally the fry of the grey mullet, of which the chiefs
are particularly fond. Every chief has, or used to have, his
own fish-pond. The natives are very skilful fishermen. In
the old days they made a great variety of fish-hooks out
of mother-of-pearl and tortoise shell as well as out of bone,
and these they dragged by means of lines behind their
canoes, and so caught bonettas, dolphins, and albicores.
They took prodigious numbers of flying fish in nets. At
the time when the islands were discovered by Captain Cook,
the natives possessed pigs and dogs. The flesh of both of
these animals was eaten, but only by persons of higher
rank. Fowls were also bred and eaten, but they were not
very common, and their flesh was not very much esteemed.
The sugar-cane was indigenous in the islands, and the people
ate it as a fruit; along with bananas and plantains it
occupied a considerable portion of every plantation. Captain
Cook found the natives skilful husbandmen, but thought
that with a more extensive system of agriculture, the islands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
could have supported three times the number of the existing
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_8_1052" id="FNanchor_8_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1052" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He remarked that the chiefs were much
addicted to the drinking of kava, and he attributed some
of the cutaneous and other diseases from which they suffered
to an immoderate use of what he calls the pernicious drug.<a name="FNanchor_9_1053" id="FNanchor_9_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1053" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 3. <i>Houses, Mechanical Arts</i></h4>

<p>Captain King observed that in some respects the natives
of the Sandwich Islands approached nearer in their manners
and customs to the Maoris of New Zealand than to their
less distant neighbours of the Society and Friendly Islands,
the Tahitians and the Tongans. In nothing, he says, is this
more observable than in their method of living together in
small towns or villages, containing from about one hundred
to two hundred houses, built pretty close together, without
any order, and with a winding path leading through them.
They were generally flanked towards the sea with loose
detached walls, intended for shelter and defence.<a name="FNanchor_10_1054" id="FNanchor_10_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1054" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The
shape of the houses was very simple. They were oblong
with very high thatched roofs, so that externally they
resembled the top of hay-stacks or rather barns with the
thatched roof sloping down steeply to two very low sides,
and with gable ends to match. The entrance, placed
indifferently in one of the sides or ends, was an oblong hole,
so low that one had rather to creep than walk in, and often
shut by a board of planks fastened together, which served as
a door. No light entered the house but by this opening,
for there were no windows. Internally every house consisted
of a single room without partitions. In spite of
the extreme simplicity of their structure, the houses were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
kept very clean; the floors were covered with a large
quantity of dried grass, over which they spread mats to sit
and sleep upon. At one end stood a kind of bench about
three feet high, on which were kept the household utensils.
These consisted merely of a few wooden bowls and trenchers,
together with gourd-shells, serving either as bottles or
baskets. The houses varied in size with the wealth or rank
of the owners. Those of the poor were mere hovels, which
resembled the sties and kennels of pigs and dogs rather
than the abodes of men. The houses of the chiefs were
generally large and commodious by comparison, some forty
to sixty feet long by twenty or thirty feet broad, and eighteen
or twenty feet high at the peak of the roof. Chiefs had
always a separate eating-house, and even people of the
lower ranks had one such house to every six or seven
families for the men. The women were forbidden to eat in
company with the men and even to enter the eating-house
during the meals; they ate in the same houses in which
they slept. The houses of the chiefs were enclosed in large
yards, and sometimes stood on stone platforms, which
rendered them more comfortable.<a name="FNanchor_11_1055" id="FNanchor_11_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1055" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In the mechanical arts the Hawaiians displayed a considerable
degree of ingenuity and skill. While the men
built the houses and canoes and fashioned wooden dishes
and bowls, the women undertook the manufacture of bark-cloth
(<i>kapa</i>) and mats. Bark-cloth was made in the usual
way from the bark of the paper-mulberry, which was beaten
out with grooved mallets. The cloth was dyed a variety
of colours, and patterns at once intricate and elegant were
stamped on it and stained in different tints. The mats
were woven or braided by hand without the use of any
frame or instrument. The materials were rushes or palm-leaves;
the mats made of palm-leaves were much the more
durable and therefore the more valuable. The coarser and
plainer were spread on the floor to sleep on; the finer were
of white colour with red stripes, rhombuses, and other figures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
interwoven on one side. Among the most curious specimens
of native carving were the wooden bowls in which the
chiefs drank kava. They were perfectly round, beautifully
polished, and supported on three or four small human
figures in various attitudes. These figures were accurately
proportioned and neatly finished; even the anatomy of the
muscles strained to support the weight were well expressed.
The fishing-hooks made by the men, especially the large
hooks made to catch shark, are described by Captain Cook
as really astonishing for their strength and neatness; he
found them on trial much superior to his own.<a name="FNanchor_12_1056" id="FNanchor_12_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1056" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The mechanical skill of these people was all the more
remarkable because of the extreme rudeness and simplicity
of the tools with which they worked. Their chief implement
was an adze made of a black or clay-coloured volcanic
stone and polished by constant friction with pumice-stone
in water. They had also small instruments made each of a
single shark's tooth, some of which were fixed to the forepart
of a dog's jawbone and others to a thin wooden handle
of the same shape. These served as knives, and pieces of
coral were used as files. Captain Cook found the natives in
possession of two iron tools, one of them a piece of iron
hoop, and the other an edge-tool, perhaps the point of
a broadsword. These they could only have procured
from a European vessel or from a wreck drifted on their
coast. No mines of any kind are known to exist in the
islands.<a name="FNanchor_13_1057" id="FNanchor_13_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_1057" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Their weapons of war included spears, javelins, daggers,
and clubs, all of them made of wood. They also slung
stones with deadly effect. But they had no defensive
armour; for the war-cloaks and wicker-work helmets, surmounted
with lofty crests and decked with the tail feathers
of the tropic bird, while they heightened the imposing and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
martial appearance of the wearers, must have proved rather
encumbrances than protections. Captain Cook found the
natives in possession of bows and arrows, but from their
scarcity and the slenderness of their make he inferred that
the Hawaiians, like other Polynesians, never used them in
battle.<a name="FNanchor_14_1058" id="FNanchor_14_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_1058" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 4. <i>Government, Social Ranks, Taboo</i></h4>

<p>The government of the Hawaiian Islands was an
absolute monarchy or despotism; all rights of power and
property vested in the king, whose will and power alone
were law, though in important matters he was to a certain
extent guided by the opinion of the chiefs in council. The
rank of the king and the chiefs was hereditary, descending
from father to son; but the appointment to all offices of
authority and dignity was made by the king alone.
Nevertheless posts of honour, influence, and emolument
often continued in the same family for many generations.
Nor were hereditary rank and authority confined to men;
they were inherited also by women. According to tradition,
several of the islands had been once or twice under the
government of a queen. The king was supported by an
annual tribute paid by all the islands at different periods
according to his directions. It comprised both the natural
produce of the country and manufactured articles. But
besides the regular tribute the king was at liberty to levy
any additional tax he might please, and even to seize and
appropriate any personal possessions of a chief or other
subject. Not infrequently the whole crop of a plantation
was thus carried off by his retainers without the least
apology or compensation.<a name="FNanchor_15_1059" id="FNanchor_15_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_1059" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> However, the government of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
whole Hawaiian archipelago by a single monarch was a
comparatively modern innovation. Down to nearly the end
of the eighteenth century the different islands were independent
of each other and governed by separate kings,
who were often at war one with the other; indeed there were
sometimes several independent kingdoms within the same
island. But towards the close of the eighteenth century an
energetic and able king of Hawaii, by name Kamehameha
(Tamehameha), succeeded in extending his sway by conquest
over the whole archipelago, and at his death in
1819 he bequeathed the undivided monarchy to his successors.<a name="FNanchor_16_1060" id="FNanchor_16_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_1060" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The whole body of chiefs fell into three classes or
ranks. The first included the royal family and all who were
intimately connected with it. The second included such as
held hereditary offices of power or governorships of islands,
after the time when the whole archipelago was united in a
single kingdom. The third class embraced the rulers of
districts, the headmen of villages, and all inferior chiefs.
The members of the first two classes were usually called
"high chiefs"; they were few in number and closely related
both by blood and marriage. The members of the third
class were known as "small" or "low" chiefs. They were
by far the most numerous body of chiefs in any island, and
were generally called <i>haku aina</i> or landowners, though
strictly speaking the king was acknowledged in every island
as the supreme lord and proprietor of the soil by hereditary
right or the law of conquest. When Kamehameha had
subdued the greater part of the islands, he distributed them
among his favourite chiefs and warriors on condition of
their rendering him not only military service, but a certain
proportion of the produce of their lands. In this he appears
to have followed the ancient practice invariably observed on
the conquest of an island.<a name="FNanchor_17_1061" id="FNanchor_17_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_1061" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> For "from the earliest periods
of Hawaiian history, the tenure of lands has been, in most
respects, feudal. The origin of the fiefs was the same as in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
the northern nations of Europe. Any chieftain who could
collect a sufficient number of followers to conquer a district,
or an island, and had succeeded in his object, proceeded to
divide the spoils, or 'cut up the land,' as the natives termed
it. The king, or principal chief, made his choice from the
best of the lands. Afterwards the remaining part of the
conquered territory was distributed among the leaders, and
these again subdivided their shares to others, who became
vassals, owing fealty to the sovereigns of the fee. The
king placed some of his own particular servants on his
portion as his agents, to superintend the cultivation. The
original occupants who were on the land, usually remained
under their new conqueror, and by them the lands were
cultivated, and rent or taxes paid."<a name="FNanchor_18_1062" id="FNanchor_18_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_1062" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Below the chiefs or nobles were the commoners, who
included small farmers, fishermen, mechanics, such as house-builders
and canoe-builders, musicians and dancers, in short,
all the labouring classes, whether they worked for a chief
or farmer or cultivated patches of land for their own
benefit.<a name="FNanchor_19_1063" id="FNanchor_19_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_1063" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> According to one account, "the common people
are generally considered as attached to the soil, and are
transferred with the land from one chief to another."<a name="FNanchor_20_1064" id="FNanchor_20_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_1064" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
But this statement is contradicted by an earlier and perhaps
better-informed writer, who spent some thirteen months in
Oahu, while the islands were still independent and before
the conversion of the people to Christianity. He tells us
that commoners were not slaves nor attached to the soil, but
at liberty to change masters when they thought proper.<a name="FNanchor_21_1065" id="FNanchor_21_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_1065" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
On this subject Captain King observes: "How far the
property of the lower class is secured against the rapacity
and despotism of the great chiefs, I cannot say, but it should
seem that it is sufficiently protected against private theft, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
mutual depredation; for not only their plantations, which
are spread over the whole country, but also their houses,
their hogs, and their cloth, were left unguarded, without the
smallest apprehensions. I have already remarked, that they
not only separate their possessions by walls in the plain
country, but that, in the woods likewise, wherever the horse-plantains
grow, they make use of small white flags in the
same manner, and for the same purpose of discriminating
property, as they do bunches of leaves at Otaheite. All
which circumstances, if they do not amount to proofs,
are strong indications that the power of the chiefs, where
property is concerned, is not arbitrary, but at least so far
circumscribed and ascertained, as to make it worth the while
for the inferior orders to cultivate the soil, and to occupy
their possessions distinct from each other."<a name="FNanchor_22_1066" id="FNanchor_22_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_1066" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Yet on the
other hand we are told by later writers that "in fact, the
condition of the common people is that of slaves; they hold
nothing which may not be taken from them by the strong
hand of arbitrary power, whether exercised by the sovereign
or a petty chief." On one occasion the writers saw nearly
two thousand persons, laden with faggots of sandal-wood,
coming down from the mountains to deposit their burdens
in the royal store-houses, and then departing to their homes,
weary with their unpaid labours, yet without a murmur at
their bondage.<a name="FNanchor_23_1067" id="FNanchor_23_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_1067" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> When at last, through contact with civilisation,
they had learned to utter their grievances, they complained
that "the people was crushed by the numerous
forced labours and contributions of every sort exacted from
them by the chiefs. It was, indeed, very hard to furnish
the chiefs, on every requisition, with pigs, food, and all the
good things which the folk possessed, and to see the great
despoiling the humble. In truth, the people worked for the
chiefs incessantly, they performed every kind of painful task,
and they paid the chiefs all the taxes which it pleased them
to demand."<a name="FNanchor_24_1068" id="FNanchor_24_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_1068" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Certainly commoners were bound to pay great outward
marks of deference to their social superiors, the chiefs, or
nobles. Indeed, the respect almost amounted to adoration,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
for they were on no occasion allowed to touch their persons,
but prostrated themselves before them, and might not enter
their houses without first receiving permission.<a name="FNanchor_25_1069" id="FNanchor_25_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_1069" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Above all,
the system of taboo or <i>kapu</i>, as it was called in the Hawaiian
dialect,<a name="FNanchor_26_1070" id="FNanchor_26_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_1070" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> oppressed the common people and tended to keep
them in a state of abject subjection to the nobles; for the
prescriptions of the system were numerous and vexatious,
and the penalty for breaches of them was death. If the
shadow of a subject fell on a chief, the subject was put to
death; if he robed himself in the cloth or assumed the girdle
of a chief, he was put to death; if he climbed on the wall of
a chief's courtyard, he was put to death; if he stood upright
instead of prostrating himself when a vessel of water was
brought for the chief to wash with or his garments to wear,
he was put to death; if he stepped on the shadow of a
chief's house with his head smeared with white clay, or
decked with a garland of flowers, or merely wetted with
water, he was put to death; if he slept with his wife on a
taboo day, he was put to death; if he made a noise during
public prayers, he was put to death; if a woman ate pig, or
coco-nuts, or bananas, or lobster, or the fish called <i>ulua</i>, she
was put to death; if she went in a canoe on a taboo day,
she was put to death; if husband and wife ate together, they
were both put to death.<a name="FNanchor_27_1071" id="FNanchor_27_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_1071" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In Hawaii, as in other parts of Polynesia, the taboo
formed an important and essential part both of the religious
and of the political system, of which it was at once a strong
support and a powerful instrument. The proper sense of
the word taboo (in Hawaiian <i>kapu</i>) is "sacred." This did
not, however, imply any moral quality; it expressed rather
"a connexion with the gods, or a separation from ordinary
purposes, and exclusive appropriation to persons or things
considered sacred"; sometimes it meant devoted as by a
vow. Chiefs who traced their genealogy to the gods were
called <i>arii taboo</i>, "chiefs sacred"; a temple was a <i>wahi taboo</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
"place sacred"; the rule which prohibited women from eating
with men, and from eating, except on special occasions, any
fruits or animals ever offered in sacrifice to the gods, while
it allowed the men to partake of them, was called <i>ai taboo</i>,
"eating sacred." The opposite of <i>kapu</i> was <i>noa</i>, which
means "general" or "common"; for example, <i>ai noa</i>
signifies "eating generally" or "having food in common."
Although it was employed for civil as well as sacred
purposes, the taboo was essentially a religious ceremony
and could be imposed only by the priests. A religious
motive was always assigned for laying it on, though it
was often done at the instance of the civil authorities; and
persons called <i>kiaimoku</i>, "island keepers," a kind of police
officers, were always appointed by the king to see that the
taboo was strictly observed.<a name="FNanchor_28_1072" id="FNanchor_28_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_1072" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The application of the restriction implied by taboo was
either general or particular, either permanent or occasional.
To take examples of permanent taboos, the idols and temples,
the persons and names of the king and other members of
the royal family, the persons of priests, canoes belonging to
the gods, the houses, clothes, and mats of the king and priests,
and the heads of men who were the devotees of any particular
idol, were always taboo or sacred. The flesh of hogs, fowls,
turtles, and several sorts of fish, coco-nuts, and almost everything
offered in sacrifice were taboo or consecrated to the use
of the gods and the men; hence women were, except in
cases of particular indulgence, forbidden to partake of them.
Particular places, such as those frequented by the king for
bathing, were also permanently taboo. As examples of temporary
taboos may be mentioned those which were imposed
on an island or district for a certain time, during which no
canoe or person was allowed to approach it. Particular
fruits, animals, and the fish of certain places were occasionally
taboo for several months, during which neither men nor
women might eat them.<a name="FNanchor_29_1073" id="FNanchor_29_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_1073" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The predecessor of Kamehameha,
king of Hawaii, "was taboo to such a degree that he was
not allowed to be seen by day. He only showed himself in
the night: if any person had but accidentally seen him by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
daylight he was immediately put to death; a sacred law,
the fulfilment of which nothing could prevent."<a name="FNanchor_30_1074" id="FNanchor_30_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_1074" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The seasons generally kept taboo were on the approach
of some great religious ceremony, immediately before going
to war, and during the sickness of chiefs. Their duration
was various, and much longer in ancient than in modern
times. Tradition tells of a taboo which lasted thirty years,
during which men might not trim their beards and were subject
to other restrictions. Another was kept for five years. Before
the reign of Kamehameha forty days was the usual period;
but in his time the period was shortened to ten or five days,
or even to a single day. The taboo seasons might be either
common or strict. During a common taboo the men were
only required to abstain from their usual avocations, and to
attend morning and evening prayers at the temple. But during
a strict taboo every fire and light in the district or island must
be extinguished; no canoe might be launched; no person
might bathe or even appear out of doors, unless his attendance
was required at the temple; no dog might bark, no pig
grunt, and no cock crow; for if any of these things were to
happen the taboo would be broken and fail to accomplish its
object. To prevent this disaster the mouths of dogs and
pigs were tied up, and fowls were put under a calabash, or a
cloth was fastened over their eyes.<a name="FNanchor_31_1075" id="FNanchor_31_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_1075" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The prohibitions of the taboo were strictly enforced;
every breach of them was punished with death, unless the
delinquent had powerful friends among the priests or chiefs,
who could save him. The culprits were generally offered in
sacrifice, being either strangled or clubbed at the temple;
according to one account, they were burnt.<a name="FNanchor_32_1076" id="FNanchor_32_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_1076" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The system seems to have been found at last too burdensome
to be borne even by the king, who under it was forbidden
to touch his food with his own hands, and had to submit
to having it put into his mouth by another person, as if
he were an infant.<a name="FNanchor_33_1077" id="FNanchor_33_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_1077" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Whatever his motive, Liholiho, son of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
Kamehameha, had hardly succeeded his father on the throne
of Hawaii when he abolished the system of taboo and the
national religion at a single blow. This remarkable reformation
took place in November 1819. When the first Christian
missionaries arrived from America, some months later, March
30th, 1820, they were astonished to learn of a peaceful
revolution, which had so opportunely prepared the way for
their own teaching.<a name="FNanchor_34_1078" id="FNanchor_34_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_1078" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 5. <i>Religion, the Gods</i></h4>

<p>Of the native Hawaiian religion, as it existed before
the advent of Europeans and the conversion of the people
to Christianity, we possess no adequate account. The defect
is probably due in great measure to the readiness with which
the islanders relinquished their old faith and adopted the
new one. The transition seems to have been effected with
great ease and comparatively little opposition; hence when
the missionaries settled in the islands a few months after the
formal abolition of the ancient religion, paganism was already
almost a thing of the past, and the Christian teachers were
either unable or perhaps unwilling to record in detail the
beliefs and rites which they regarded as false and pernicious.
Be that as it may, we possess no such comparatively full and
accurate records of the old Hawaiian religion, as we possess,
for example, of the old pagan religion of the Tongans and
the Samoans, who clung much more pertinaciously to the
creed of their fathers than their more enlightened or more
fickle kinsfolk in the Sandwich Islands. Hence we are
obliged to content ourselves with some more or less meagre
and fragmentary notices of the ancient Hawaiian system of
religious belief and practice. But as the Hawaiians are, or
were, pure-blooded Polynesians, we may assume with a fair
degree of probability that in its broad lines their religious
system conformed to the ordinary Polynesian type.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>On this subject Captain King, the colleague and successor
of Captain Cook in his last voyage, observes as follows:
"The religion of these people resembles, in most of its
principal features, that of the Society and Friendly Islands.
Their <i>Morais</i>, their <i>Whattas</i>, their idols, their sacrifices, and
their sacred songs, all of which they have in common with
each other, are convincing proofs that their religious notions
are derived from the same source. In the length and number
of their ceremonies this branch indeed far exceeds the rest;
and though in all these countries there is a certain class of
men to whose care the performance of their religious rites is
committed, yet we had never met with a regular society of
priests, till we discovered the cloisters of Kakooa in Karakakooa
Bay [in the island of Hawaii]. The head of this order
was called <i>Orono</i>; a title which we imagined to imply something
highly sacred, and which, in the person of Omeeah, was
honoured almost to adoration.... It has been mentioned
that the title of <i>Orono</i>, with all its honours, was given to
Captain Cook; and it is also certain that they regarded us
generally as a race of people superior to themselves; and used
often to say that great <i>Eatooa</i> [<i>atuas</i>, spirits] dwelled in our
country. The little image, which we have before described
as the favourite idol on the <i>Morai</i> in Karakakooa Bay, they
called <i>Koonooraekaiee</i>, and said it was Terreeoboo's god, and
that he also resided amongst us. There are found an infinite
variety of these images both on the <i>Morais</i>, and within and
without their houses, to which they give different names;
but it soon became obvious to us in how little estimation
they were held, from their frequent expressions of contempt
of them, and from their even offering them to sale for trifles.
At the same time there seldom failed to be some one particular
figure in favour, to which, whilst this preference lasted,
all their adoration was addressed. This consisted in arraying
it in red cloth, beating their drums, and singing hymns before
it, laying bunches of red feathers, and different sorts of
vegetables, at its feet, and exposing a pig or a dog to rot on
the <i>whatta</i> that stood near it. In a bay to the southward
of Karakakooa, a party of our gentlemen were conducted to
a large house, in which they found the black figure of a man,
resting on his fingers and toes, with his head inclined backward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
the limbs well formed and exactly proportioned, and
the whole beautifully polished. This figure the natives call
<i>Maee</i>; and round it were placed thirteen others of rude and
distorted shapes, which they said were the <i>Eatooas</i> [spirits]
of several deceased chiefs, whose names they recounted. The
place was full of <i>whattas</i>, on which lay the remains of their
offerings. They likewise give a place in their houses to
many ludicrous and some obscene idols, like the Priapus of
the ancients."<a name="FNanchor_35_1079" id="FNanchor_35_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_1079" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The general Hawaiian name for god was <i>akua</i>, corresponding
to the more usual Polynesian form <i>atua</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36_1080" id="FNanchor_36_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_1080" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The
four principal Hawaiian deities were Ku, Kane, Kanaloa,
and Lono.<a name="FNanchor_37_1081" id="FNanchor_37_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_1081" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Their names are only dialectically different
forms of Tu, Tane, Tangaroa or Tagaloa, and Rongo, four
of the greatest Polynesian gods.<a name="FNanchor_38_1082" id="FNanchor_38_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_1082" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Of these deities it is said
that Ku, Kane, and Lono formed the original Hawaiian
triad or trinity, who were worshipped as a unity under the
name of Ku-kau-akahi, "the one established."<a name="FNanchor_39_1083" id="FNanchor_39_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_1083" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The
meaning or essence of the three persons of the trinity is
said to be Stability (Ku), Light (Tane), and Sound (Lono).<a name="FNanchor_40_1084" id="FNanchor_40_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_1084" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
"These gods," we are told, "created the three heavens as
their dwelling-place, then the earth, sun, moon, and stars,
then, the host of angels and ministers. Kanaloa (Tangaroa),
who represented the spirit of evil, was a later introduction
into the Hawaiian theology; he it was who led the rebellion
of spirits, although Milu is in other traditions credited with
this bad pre-eminence."<a name="FNanchor_41_1085" id="FNanchor_41_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_1085" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> We read that when the trinity were
at work on the task of creating the first man, the bad spirit
Kanaloa, out of rivalry, also made an image, but he could
not endow it with life. So, in a rage, he cried to Kane, "I
will take your man, he shall die!" And that, it is said, was
the origin of death. The reason why the spirits, under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
leadership of Kanaloa, rebelled was that they had been
denied the sacrifice of kava. For their rebellion they were
thrust down to the lowest depth of Darkness or Night (<i>Po</i>).<a name="FNanchor_42_1086" id="FNanchor_42_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_1086" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>A fuller account of these momentous transactions presents
a close, perhaps a suspicious, resemblance to the Biblical
narrative of the same events. It runs as follows:</p>

<p>"According to ancient Hawaiian traditions, there existed
in the chaos three mighty gods, Kane, Ku, and Lono. By
their common action light was brought into the chaos.
Then the gods created three heavenly spheres, in which they
dwelt, and last of all the earth, sun, moon, and stars. Out
of their spittle they thereupon created a host of angels, who
had to render service to the three original deities. Last of
all came the creation of man. His body was fashioned out
of red earth, and his head out of white clay, and Kane, the
highest of the gods, breathed into this Hawaiian Adam the
breath of life. Out of one of his ribs the Hawaiian Eve
was created. The newly formed pair, by name Kumuhonua
and Keolakuhonua, were placed in a beautiful paradise called
Paliuli, which was watered by the three rivers of life, and
planted with many fine trees, among them the sacred bread-fruit
tree. The mightiest of the angels, Kanaloa, the
Hawaiian Lucifer, desired that the newly created human
pair should worship him, which was forbidden by God the
Father, Kane. After vain attempts to create a new man
devoted to himself, Kanaloa, out of desire for vengeance,
resolved to ruin the first human pair created by the gods.
In the likeness of a great lizard he crept into Paradise and
seduced the two inhabitants of the same into committing
sin, whereupon they were driven out of Paradise by a
powerful bird sent by Kane. Then follow, as in the Bible,
the legends of the Hawaiian Cain (Laka) and the Hawaiian
Noah (Nuu), by whom the ancestors of the Hawaiian people
are said to have been saved from the universal flood."<a name="FNanchor_43_1087" id="FNanchor_43_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_1087" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The
story of the creation of the first woman out of a rib of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
first man appears to have been widespread in Polynesia, for
it is reported also from Tahiti,<a name="FNanchor_44_1088" id="FNanchor_44_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_1088" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Fakaofo or Bowditch Island,<a name="FNanchor_45_1089" id="FNanchor_45_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_1089" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>

<p>Of the three persons in the Hawaiian trinity, Kane
(Tane) is said to have been the principal. He was especially
associated with light; in a fragment of an ancient liturgy he
is called Heaven-father (<i>Lani-makua</i>) and in a very ancient
chant he is identified with the Creator. When after the
great flood the Hawaiian Noah, who is called Nuu, left his
vessel, he offered up sacrifice to the moon, saying, "You are
doubtless a transformation of Tane." But the deity was
angry at this worship of a material object; nevertheless,
when Nuu expressed his contrition, the rainbow was left as
a pledge of forgiveness.<a name="FNanchor_47_1091" id="FNanchor_47_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_1091" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>According to one account, the two great gods Kane and
Kanaloa were twins. In Hawaii twins are regarded as
superior to ordinary mortals both in mind and body; hence
it was natural to conceive of a pair of divine twins, like the
Dioscuri in Greek mythology. And, like the Dioscuri, the
divine Hawaiian twins sometimes appeared together to their
worshippers as helpers in time of need. Thus, in a season
of dearth, when people were dying of hunger, a poor fisher
lad in the island of Lanai set up a tiny hut on the sea-shore,
and there day by day he offered a little from the scanty
store of fish which his family had caught; and as he did so
he prayed, saying, "Here, O god, is fish for thee." One
day, as he sat there, racked with unsatisfied yearning for the
divine assistance, two men came walking that way and
rested at the hut; and, taking them to be weary wanderers,
the fisher lad willingly gave them what little food he had
left over. They slept there that night, and next day, when
they were departing, they revealed themselves to him as
the two gods Kane and Kanaloa, and they told him that his
prayer had been heard, and that salvation would follow.
Sure enough, plenty soon returned to the land, and on the
spot where the little hut had stood, a stone temple was built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
in stately terraces.<a name="FNanchor_48_1092" id="FNanchor_48_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_1092" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Again, we hear how when drought had
lasted long in the island of Oahu, and death stared the
farmers in the face for lack of water, the gods Kane and
Kanaloa appeared in the likeness of two young men and
showed them a spring, which was afterwards consecrated to
the divine twins.<a name="FNanchor_49_1093" id="FNanchor_49_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_1093" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Once more, it is said that, when the two
deities were in Oahu, it chanced that they could find no
water with which to moisten their dry food. Then at Kane's
direction Kanaloa struck a stone with his spear, and from
the stone there sprang a fountain, which bears the name of
Kane to this day, and still it rises and sinks on the day of
the moon which is sacred to that divinity.<a name="FNanchor_50_1094" id="FNanchor_50_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_1094" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The god Lono was, as we have seen, no other than
the great Polynesian deity Rongo, the two names being the
same word in dialectically different forms. He was one of
the most popular gods of Hawaii;<a name="FNanchor_51_1095" id="FNanchor_51_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_1095" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the seasons and other
natural phenomena were associated with him, and prayers
for rain were particularly addressed to him.<a name="FNanchor_52_1096" id="FNanchor_52_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_1096" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> According to
one account, he was an uncreated, self-existent deity;<a name="FNanchor_53_1097" id="FNanchor_53_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_1097" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> but
according to another account he was an ancient king of
Hawaii, who rashly killed his wife on a suspicion of infidelity,
and then, full of remorse, carried her lifeless body to a temple
and made a great wail over it. Thereafter he travelled
through Hawaii in a state of frenzy, boxing and wrestling
with every one whom he met. The people in astonishment
said, "Is Lono entirely mad?" He replied, "I am frantic
with my great love." Having instituted games to commemorate
his wife's death, he embarked in a triangular
canoe for a foreign land. Before he departed, he prophesied,
saying, "I will return in after times, on an island bearing
coco-nut trees, swine, and dogs." After his departure he
was deified by his countrymen, and annual games of boxing
and wrestling were instituted in his honour.<a name="FNanchor_54_1098" id="FNanchor_54_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_1098" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> When Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
Cook arrived in Hawaii, the natives took him to be their god
Lono returned according to his prophecy. The priests threw
a sacred red mantle on his shoulders and did him reverence,
prostrating themselves before him; they pronounced long
discourses with extreme volubility, by way of prayer and
worship. They offered him pigs and food and clothes,
and everything that they offered to the gods. When
he landed, most of the inhabitants fled before him, full
of fear, and those who remained prostrated themselves
in adoration. They led him to a temple, and there they
worshipped him. But afterwards in a brawl, when they saw
his blood flowing and heard his groans, they said, "No, this
is not Rono," and one of them struck him, so that he died.
But even after his death, some of them still thought that he
was Rono, and that he would come again. So they looked
on some of his bones, to wit his ribs and his breastbone, as
sacred; they put them in a little basket covered all over
with red feathers, and they deposited it in a temple dedicated
to Rono. There religious homage was paid to the bones,
and thence they were carried every year in procession to
several other temples, or borne by the priests round the
island, to collect the offerings of the faithful for the support
of the worship of the god Rono.<a name="FNanchor_55_1099" id="FNanchor_55_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_1099" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The great Polynesian god or hero Maui was known in
Hawaii, where the stories told of him resembled those current
in other parts of the Pacific. He is said to have dragged
up the islands on his fishing-hook from the depths of the
ocean, and to have brought men their first fire.<a name="FNanchor_56_1100" id="FNanchor_56_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_1100" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> One day,
when his wife was making bark-cloth and had not time to
finish it before night, Maui laid his hand on the sun and
prevented it from going down till the work was completed.<a name="FNanchor_57_1101" id="FNanchor_57_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_1101" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The national war-god of Hawaii was named Tairi (Kaili).
In the evening he used to be seen flitting about near his
temple in the form of a sort of luminous vapour, like a flame
or the tail of a comet. A similar appearance is also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
occasionally seen in the Society Islands, where the terrified
natives formerly identified it with their god Tane, and
supposed that the meteor was the deity flying from temple
to temple or seeking whom he might destroy.<a name="FNanchor_58_1102" id="FNanchor_58_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_1102" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The image
of the war-god Tairi used to be carried to battle by the
priest, who held it aloft above the ranks. It was four or
five feet high; the upper part was of wicker-work, covered
with red feathers; the face grinned hideously; the mouth
displayed triple rows of dog's or shark's teeth; the eyes
gleamed with mother of pearl; and the head was crowned
with a helmet crested with long tresses of human hair. In
the battle the priest used to distort his face into a variety of
frightful grimaces and to utter appalling yells, which were
supposed to proceed from the god whom he bore or attended.
But the national war-god was not the only deity whose
image was borne to battle. Other chiefs of rank had their
war-gods carried near them by their priests; and if the king
or chief was killed or taken, the god himself was usually
captured also. The presence of their deities inspired the
warriors with courage; for they imagined the divine influence
to be essential to victory.<a name="FNanchor_59_1103" id="FNanchor_59_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_1103" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The diviners were consulted
immediately before a battle. They slew the victims, and
noticed the face of the heavens, the passage of clouds over
the sun, and the appearance of a rainbow. If the omens
were favourable, the image of the principal war-god was
brought out in front of the whole army and placed near the
king. The priest then prayed to the gods, beseeching them
to prove themselves stronger than the gods of the enemy in
the ensuing engagement, and promising them hecatombs of
victims in the event of victory. The bodies of foes slain
in the battle were dragged to the king or priest, who offered
them as victims to his gods.<a name="FNanchor_60_1104" id="FNanchor_60_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_1104" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The gods of Hawaii fell into two classes, according as
they were believed to have been primaeval deities born of
Night (Po), or the souls of men who had been deified after
death. For it was believed to be possible to detain the
soul of a beloved or honoured person at death by keeping
his clothes or his bones; and the soul could thereafter be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
invoked and could speak through the mouth of the person
into whom it had entered. Both classes of deities, the
primaeval and the human, were credited with the power of
making people ill.<a name="FNanchor_61_1105" id="FNanchor_61_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_1105" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> One way of obtaining a guardian deity
for a family was to take the body of a still-born child and
throw it into the sea or bury it in the earth; in the former
case the embryo was supposed to turn into a shark, in the
latter case into a grasshopper. When it was deemed necessary
to obtain the help of a deity (<i>akua</i>) for a special
purpose, such as success in fishing or in canoe-building, the
divine spirit could be conjured into an image (<i>kii</i>), and could
thereafter appear in a dream to his worshipper and reveal to
him what food he desired to have dedicated to him, and
what accordingly the worshipper must abstain from eating.
Often the god showed himself to the dreamer in the shape
of a stone or other object; and on awakening the man was
bound to procure the object, whatever it was, and to honour
it with prayer and sacrifice, in order to ensure the protection
of the deity. Prayers addressed to private gods were usually
the property of the owner, who was commonly also their
author; whereas prayers addressed to a public god, such as
Kane, had to be learned from a priest or other adept.<a name="FNanchor_62_1106" id="FNanchor_62_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_1106" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Among the deities who had once been men would seem
to have been the god of medicine, the Hawaiian Aesculapius.
It is said that many generations ago a certain man named
Koreamoku received all medicinal herbs from the gods, who
also taught him the use of them. After his death he was
deified, and a wooden image of him was placed in a large
temple at Kairua, to which offerings of hogs, fish, and coco-nuts
were frequently presented. Oronopuha and Makanuiairomo,
two friends and disciples of Koreamoku, continued
to practise the healing art after the death of their master,
and they too were deified after death, particularly because
they were often successful in driving away the evil spirits
which afflicted the people and threatened them with death.
To these deified men the priests addressed their prayers
when they administered medicine to the sick.<a name="FNanchor_63_1107" id="FNanchor_63_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_1107" class="fnanchor">[63]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the deities of Hawaii the most dreaded was Pele,
the goddess of the volcanic fire, whose home was in the
great and ever active volcano of Kilauea. There she dwelt
with the other members of her family, brothers and sisters.
They were all said to have come to Hawaii from a foreign
country called Tahiti after the great deluge had subsided.
The cones which rise like islands from the vast sea of boiling
lava, vomiting columns of smoke or pyramids of flame, were
the houses where these volcanic deities lived and amused
themselves by playing at draughts: the crackling of the
flames and the roaring of the furnaces were the music of
their dance; and the red flaming surge was the surf wherein
they sported, swimming on the rolling fiery waves.<a name="FNanchor_64_1108" id="FNanchor_64_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_1108" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The
filaments of volcanic glass, of a dark olive colour and as fine
as human hair, some straight, some crimped or frizzled,
which are to be seen abundantly on the sides of the crater,
and on the plain for miles round, are called by the natives
"Pele's hair"; in some places they lie so thick as to
resemble cobwebs covering the surface of the ground.<a name="FNanchor_65_1109" id="FNanchor_65_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_1109" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Near the crater grow bushes bearing clusters of red and
yellow berries resembling large currants; of these the
natives formerly would never eat till they had thrown some
of the clusters into the thickest of the smoke and vapour as
an offering to the goddess of the volcano.<a name="FNanchor_66_1110" id="FNanchor_66_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_1110" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Vast numbers
of hogs, some alive, others cooked, used to be cast into the
craters when they were in action or when they threatened
an eruption; and when they boiled over, the animals were
flung into the rolling torrent of lava to appease the gods
and arrest the progress of the fiery stream. For the whole
island had to pay tribute to the gods of the volcano and to
furnish provisions for the support of their ministers; and
whenever the chiefs or people failed to send the proper
offerings or incurred the displeasure of the dreadful beings
by insulting them or their ministers, or by breaking the
taboos which had to be observed in the vicinity of the
craters, the angry deities would spout lava from the
mountain or march by subterranean passages to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
abode of the culprits and overwhelm them under a flood of
molten matter. And if the fishermen did not offer them
enough fish, they would rush down, kill the fish with fire,
and, filling up the shoals, destroy the fishing-grounds
entirely.<a name="FNanchor_67_1111" id="FNanchor_67_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_1111" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> People who passed by the volcano of Kilauea
often presented locks of hair to Pele by throwing them into
the crater with an appropriate address to the deity.<a name="FNanchor_68_1112" id="FNanchor_68_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_1112" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> On
one occasion, when a river of lava threatened destruction to
the people of the neighbourhood, and the sacrifice of many
hogs, cast alive into the stream, had not availed to stay its
devastating course, King Kamehameha cut off some of his
own sacred locks and threw them into the torrent, with the
result that in a day or two the lava ceased to flow.<a name="FNanchor_69_1113" id="FNanchor_69_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_1113" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In the
pleasant and verdant valley of Kaua there used to be a
temple of the goddess, where the inhabitants of Hamakua,
a district of Hawaii, formerly celebrated an annual festival
designed to propitiate the dread divinity and to secure their
country from earthquakes and floods of lava. On such
occasions large offerings of hogs, dogs, and fruit were made,
and the priests performed certain rites.<a name="FNanchor_70_1114" id="FNanchor_70_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_1114" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Worshippers of
Pele also threw some of the bones of their dead into the
volcano, in the belief that the spirits of the deceased would
then be admitted to the society of the volcanic deities, and
that their influence would preserve the survivors from the
ravages of volcanic fire.<a name="FNanchor_71_1115" id="FNanchor_71_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_1115" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Nevertheless the apprehensions
uniformly entertained by the natives of the fearful consequences
of Pele's anger prevented them from paying very
frequent visits to the vicinity of the volcano; and when on
their inland journeys they had occasion to approach the
mountain, they were scrupulously attentive to every injunction
of her priests, and regarded with a degree of
superstitious veneration and awe the appalling spectacle
which the crater, with its sea of molten and flaming lava,
presented to their eyes.<a name="FNanchor_72_1116" id="FNanchor_72_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_1116" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> They even requested strangers
not to dig or scratch the sand in its neighbourhood for fear
of displeasing the goddess and provoking her to manifest
her displeasure by an eruption.<a name="FNanchor_73_1117" id="FNanchor_73_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_1117" class="fnanchor">[73]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>The service of Pele was regularly cared for by an
hereditary steward (<i>kahu</i>) and an hereditary priestess. The
duty of the steward was to provide the materials for the public
sacrifices, including the food and raiment for the goddess;
it was for him to furnish the hogs and fowls, to cultivate the
taro, sweet potatoes, and sugar-cane which were to serve her
for nourishment, to tend the plants from which her garments
were to be made, and to have all things in readiness for the
offerings at the appointed seasons. Of the plantations sacred
to this use, one was on the sea-shore, and another in the broken
ground within the precincts of the crater; and the steward
with his family resided sometimes in the one place and
sometimes in the other. When the time came for offering
the sacrifice, the priestess descended into the depths of the
volcano, and there approaching as near as possible to the
spot where the fire burned most furiously, she cast into it
her gifts, saying, "Here, Pele, is food for you, and here is
cloth," whereby she mentioned each article as she flung it
into the flames.<a name="FNanchor_74_1118" id="FNanchor_74_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_1118" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Sometimes the priestess claimed to be
inspired by Pele and even to be the goddess in person.
One of the priestesses, in an interview with the missionary
William Ellis, assumed a haughty air and declared, "I am
Pele; I shall never die; and those who follow me, when
they die, if part of their bones be taken to Kilauea, will
live with me in the bright fires there." In a song she gave
a long account of the deeds and honours of the goddess,
who, she said, dwelt in the volcano and had come in former
times from the land beyond the sky. This song she chanted
or recited in a rapid and vociferous manner, accompanied
by extravagant gestures, working herself up to a state of
excitement in which she appeared to lose all self-command.
She also claimed to be able to heal the sick through the
indwelling spirit of the goddess.<a name="FNanchor_75_1119" id="FNanchor_75_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_1119" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> But the goddess was
served also by priests. We read of one such who offered
prayers to her and assured the people that thereafter she
would do them no harm.<a name="FNanchor_76_1120" id="FNanchor_76_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_1120" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The Hawaiians also paid religious reverence to certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
birds, fish, and animals. In a village Captain King saw
two tame ravens which the people told him were <i>eatooas</i>
(<i>atuas</i>, <i>akuas</i>), that is, gods or spirits, cautioning him at the
same time not to hurt or offend them.<a name="FNanchor_77_1121" id="FNanchor_77_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_1121" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The native authors
of a work on the history of Hawaii, speaking of the ancient
religion of their people, tell us that "birds served some as
idols; if it was a fowl, the fowl was taboo for the worshippers,
and the same for all the birds which were deified.
The idol of another was a four-footed animal, and if it was
a pig, the pig was taboo for him. So with all the animals
who became gods. Another had a stone for his idol; it
became taboo, and he could not sit upon the stone. The
idol of another was a fish, and if it was a shark, the shark
was taboo for him. So with all the fish, and so they deified
all things in earth and heaven, and all the bones of men."<a name="FNanchor_78_1122" id="FNanchor_78_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_1122" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Further, the same writers observe that "the trees were idols
for the people and for the chiefs. If a man had for his
idol the <i>ohia</i> tree, the <i>ohia</i> was taboo for him; if the bread-fruit
tree was the idol of another, the bread-fruit tree was
taboo for him. The taboo existed likewise for all the trees
out of which men had made divine images, and it was the
same also for food. If taro was a person's idol, taro was
taboo for him. It was the same for all the eatables of
which they had made gods."<a name="FNanchor_79_1123" id="FNanchor_79_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_1123" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This deification of birds,
fish, animals, plants, and inanimate objects resembles the
Samoan system and may, like it, be a relic of totemism.<a name="FNanchor_80_1124" id="FNanchor_80_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_1124" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
Among the living creatures to which they thus accorded
divine honours were lizards, rats, and owls.<a name="FNanchor_81_1125" id="FNanchor_81_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_1125" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Among the deified fishes it would seem that the shark
held a foremost place. On almost every cape jutting out
into the sea, a temple used to be built for the worship of
the shark. The first fish of each kind, taken by the fishermen,
were always carried to the temple and offered to the
god, who was supposed to have driven them towards the
shore.<a name="FNanchor_82_1126" id="FNanchor_82_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_1126" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> When the king or the priests imagined that the
shark wanted food, they sallied forth with their attendants,
one of whom carried a rope with a running noose. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
coming to a group or crowd of people, they threw the rope
among them, and whoever happened to be taken in the
snare, whether man, woman, or child, was strangled on the
spot, the body cut in pieces, and flung into the sea, to be
bolted by the ravenous monsters.<a name="FNanchor_83_1127" id="FNanchor_83_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_1127" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Fishermen sometimes
wrapped their dead in red native cloth, and threw them into
the sea to be devoured by the sharks. They thought that
the soul of the deceased would animate the shark which
had eaten his body, and that the sharks would therefore
spare the survivors in the event of a mishap at sea.<a name="FNanchor_84_1128" id="FNanchor_84_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_1128" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> It
was especially stillborn children that were thus disposed of.
The worshipper of the shark would lay the body of the
infant on a mat, and having placed beside it two roots of
taro, one of kava, and a piece of sugar-cane, he would recite
some prayers, and then throw the whole bundle into the
sea, fully persuaded that by means of this offering the transmigration
of the soul of the child into the body of a shark
would be effected, and that thenceforth the formidable monster
would be ready to spare such members of the family as
might afterwards be exposed to his attack. In the temples
dedicated to sharks there were priests who, at sunrise and
sunset, addressed their prayers to the image which represented
the shark; and they rubbed themselves constantly
with water and salt, which, drying on their skin, made it
appear covered with scales. They also dressed in red
cloth, uttered piercing yells, and leaped over the wall of the
sacred enclosure; moreover they persuaded the islanders that
they knew the exact moment when the children that had
been thrown into the sea were transformed into sharks, and
for this discovery they were rewarded by the happy parents
with liberal presents of little pigs, roots of kava, coco-nuts,
and so forth.<a name="FNanchor_85_1129" id="FNanchor_85_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_1129" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The priests also professed to be inspired by
sharks and in that condition to foretell future events. Many
people accepted these professions in good faith and contributed
to support the professors by their offerings.<a name="FNanchor_86_1130" id="FNanchor_86_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_1130" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>From the foregoing account it appears that some at least
of the worshipful sharks were supposed to be animated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
the souls of the dead. Whether the worship of other sacred
animals in Hawaii was in like manner combined with a
theory of transmigration, there seems to be no evidence to
decide. We have seen that a similar doubt rests on the
worship of animals in Tonga.<a name="FNanchor_87_1131" id="FNanchor_87_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_1131" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 6. <i>Priests, Sorcerers, Diviners</i></h4>

<p>The priesthood formed a numerous and powerful body.
Their office was hereditary. They owned much property
in people and lands, which were heavily taxed for their
support. Each chief had his family priest, who followed
him to battle, carried his war-god, and superintended all the
sacred rites of his household. The priests took rank from
their gods and chiefs. The keeper of the national war-god,
who was immediately attached to the person of the king,
was the high priest.<a name="FNanchor_88_1132" id="FNanchor_88_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_1132" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> In the inner court of the great temple
dedicated to Tairi, the war-god, stood a lofty frame of
wicker-work, in shape something like an obelisk, hollow
within and measuring four or five feet square at the base.
Within this framework the priest stood and gave oracles in
the name of the god, whenever the king came to consult the
deity on any matter of importance, such as a declaration of
war or the conclusion of peace; for the war-god was also
the king's oracle. The oracular answer, given by the priest
in a distinct and audible voice, was afterwards reported by
the king, publicly proclaimed, and generally acted upon.<a name="FNanchor_89_1133" id="FNanchor_89_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_1133" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
When the villages failed to pay their tribute punctually to
the king, he used to send forth a priest bearing the image
of the great god Rono, who scoured the country of the
defaulters for twenty-three days and obliged them to pay
double tribute. The priest who bore the image was strictly
tabooed; during his peregrination he might not touch anything
with his hands; his food had to be put into his mouth
either by the chiefs of the villages where he halted or by
the king himself, who accompanied him.<a name="FNanchor_90_1134" id="FNanchor_90_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_1134" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Distinct from the regular priests were the diviners or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
sorcerers who formed a sort of lower priesthood or clergy.
Their services were employed for various purposes, such as
to discover the cause of illness or to detect a thief. The
people generally believed that all deaths, which were not
due to acts of violence, were wrought either by the action of
a deity or by the incantations of a sorcerer. Hence in cases
of protracted illness the aid of one of these inferior clergy
was almost invariably sought by all who could procure a
dog and a fowl for the necessary sacrifice to the god, and a
piece or two of cloth as a fee for the priest. But the
offerings to the god and the fees to the priest naturally
varied with the rank or wealth of the sufferer. After
sacrificing the victims the priest lay down to sleep, and
if his prayers were answered, he was usually able to inform
the invalid of the cause of his illness, which had been
revealed to him in a dream. But the same men, who could
thus heal the sick by ascertaining and removing the cause
of sickness, were supposed to possess the power of praying
or enchanting people to death by the recitation of spells
or incantations. The prayers or incantations which they
employed for these beneficent or maleficent purposes varied
with the individual: every practitioner had his own formulas,
the knowledge of which he carefully confined to his own
family; and he who was thought to have most influence
with his god was most frequently employed by the people
and derived the greatest emoluments from his profession.<a name="FNanchor_91_1135" id="FNanchor_91_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_1135" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Of
this class of men the most dreaded were those who invoked
the god Uli as their patron deity. Their special business was
to kill people by their spells, which they recited secretly, and
for the most part by night; but to render these effectual
it was necessary for them to obtain some of the personal
refuse of their victim, such as his spittle, the parings of his
nails, or the clippings of his hair, which they buried or
burned with the appropriate incantations.<a name="FNanchor_92_1136" id="FNanchor_92_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_1136" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Hence the
king of Hawaii was constantly attended by a servant
carrying a spittoon in which he collected the royal saliva<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
to prevent it from being used by the king's enemies for
his injury or destruction.<a name="FNanchor_93_1137" id="FNanchor_93_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_1137" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Ordinary chiefs seem to have
adopted the same precaution; a confidential servant deposited
their spittle carefully in a portable spittoon and buried it
every morning.<a name="FNanchor_94_1138" id="FNanchor_94_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_1138" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>A form of divination or magic was employed to detect
a thief. The person who had suffered the loss used to
apply to a priest, to whom he presented a pig and told his
story. Thereupon the priest kindled a fire by rubbing two
pieces of wood together, and having taken three nuts he
broke the shells and threw one of the kernels into the fire,
saying, "Kill or shoot the fellow." If the thief did not
appear before the nut was consumed in the flames, the
priest repeated the ceremony with the other two nuts.
Such was the fear inspired by this rite that the culprit
seldom failed to come forward and acknowledge his guilt.
But if he persisted in concealing his crime, the king would
cause proclamation to be made throughout the island that
so-and-so had been robbed, and that the robber or robbers
had been prayed to death. So firm was the belief of the
people in the power of these prayers, that the criminal, on
hearing the proclamation, would pine away, refuse food, and
fall a victim to his own credulity.<a name="FNanchor_95_1139" id="FNanchor_95_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_1139" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 7. <i>Temples, Images, Human Sacrifices</i></h4>

<p>Of the Hawaiian temples, as they existed before the
abolition of the native religion, we seem to possess no good
and clear description. When Captain Cook first visited
Hawaii and was sailing along the coast, he noticed from the
ship at every village one or more elevated white objects, like
pyramids or rather obelisks; one of them he judged to be
fifty feet high. On landing to examine it, he could not
reach it on account of an intervening pool of water. However,
he visited another structure of the same sort in a
more accessible situation, and found that it stood in what he
calls a burying-ground or <i>morai</i> closely resembling those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
which he had seen in other Polynesian islands and especially
in Tahiti. This particular <i>morai</i> was an oblong space, of
considerable extent, surrounded by a wall of stone, about
four feet high. The area enclosed was loosely paved with
smaller stones; and at one end of it stood the pyramid or
obelisk, measuring about four feet square at the base and
about twenty feet high. The four sides were composed, not
of stones, but of small poles interwoven with twigs and
branches, thus forming an indifferent wicker-work, hollow or
open within from bottom to top. It seemed to be in a
rather ruinous state, but enough remained to show that it
had been originally covered with the light grey cloth to which
the natives attached a religious significance. It was no
doubt with similar cloth that the white pyramids or obelisks
were covered which Captain Cook beheld in the distance from
the deck of his ship. Beside the particular pyramid which he
examined Captain Cook found a sacrificial stage or altar with
plantains laid upon it. The pyramids or obelisks which he
thus saw and described were presumably the structures in
which the priests concealed themselves when they gave
oracles in the name of the god. On the farther side of the
area of the <i>morai</i> of which Captain Cook has given us a
description stood a house or shed about ten feet high, forty
feet long, and ten broad in the middle, but tapering somewhat
towards the ends. The entrance into it was at the
middle of the side, which was in the <i>morai</i>. On the farther
side of the house, opposite the entrance, stood two wooden
images, each cut out of a single piece, with pedestals, in all
about three feet high, not badly designed nor executed.
They were said to represent goddesses (<i>eatooa no veheina</i>).
On the head of one of them was a carved helmet, and on
the other a cylindrical cap like the head-dress worn at Tahiti.
In the middle of the house, and before the two images, was
an oblong space, enclosed by a low edging of stone and
covered with shreds of the same grey cloth which draped the
pyramid or obelisk. Within this enclosure seven chiefs lay
buried; and outside the house, just on one side of the
entrance, were two small square spaces in which a man and
a hog were buried respectively, after being killed and
sacrificed to the divinity. At a little distance from these,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
and near the middle of the <i>morai</i>, were three more of these
square enclosed places, in which three chiefs had been
interred. In front of their graves was an oblong enclosed
space in which, as Captain Cook was told, three human
victims were buried, each of them having been sacrificed
at the funeral of one of the three chiefs. Within the area
of the <i>morai</i> or burying-ground, as Captain Cook calls it,
were planted trees of various kinds. Similar sanctuaries
appeared to Captain Cook to abound in the island; the
particular one described by him he believed to be among
the least considerable, being far less conspicuous than
several others which he had seen in sailing along the
coast.<a name="FNanchor_96_1140" id="FNanchor_96_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_1140" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>From his description we may infer that the temples
(<i>morais</i>) observed by him did not contain stone pyramids
like those which formed such prominent features in the
Tahitian sanctuaries and in the burial grounds of the
Tooitongas in Tongataboo; for the pyramids, or rather
obelisks, of wicker-work seen by Captain Cook in the
Hawaiian sanctuaries were obviously structures of a wholly
different kind. But there seem to be some grounds for
thinking that stone pyramids, built in steps or terraces, did
occur in some of the Hawaiian temples. Thus Captain
King saw a <i>morai</i>, as he calls it, which consisted of a square
solid pile of stones about forty yards long, twenty broad,
and fourteen [feet?] in height. The top was flat and well
paved, and surrounded by a wooden rail, on which were fixed
the skulls of captives who had been sacrificed on the death
of chiefs. The ascent to the top of the pile was easy, but
whether it was a staircase or an inclined plane is not
mentioned by Captain King. At one end of the temple or
sacred enclosure was an irregular kind of scaffold supported
on poles more than twenty feet high, at the foot of which
were twelve images ranged in a semicircle with a sacrificial
table or altar in front of them. On the scaffold Captain
Cook was made to stand, and there, swathed in red cloth, he
received the adoration of the natives, who offered him a hog
and chanted a long litany in his honour.<a name="FNanchor_97_1141" id="FNanchor_97_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_1141" class="fnanchor">[97]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p>When Kamehameha was busy conquering the archipelago
in the last years of the eighteenth century, he
built a great temple (<i>heiau</i>) for his war-god Tairi in the
island of Hawaii. Some thirty years later the ruined
temple was visited and described by the missionary William
Ellis. He says: "Its shape is an irregular parallelogram,
224 feet long, and 100 wide. The walls, though built of
loose stones, were solid and compact. At both ends, and
on the side next the mountains, they were twenty feet
high, twelve feet thick at the bottom, but narrowed in
gradually towards the top, where a course of smooth stones,
six feet wide, formed a pleasant walk. The walls next the
sea were not more than seven or eight feet high, and were
proportionally wide. The entrance to the temple is by a
narrow passage between two high walls.... The upper
terrace within the area was spacious, and much better
finished than the lower ones. It was paved with flat smooth
stones, brought from a distance. At the south end was a
kind of inner court, which might be called the sanctum
sanctorum of the temple, where the principal idol used to
stand, surrounded by a number of images of inferior
deities.... On the outside, near the entrance to the inner
court, was the place of the <i>rere</i> (altar) on which human
and other sacrifices were offered. The remains of one of
the pillars that supported it were pointed out by the natives,
and the pavement around was strewed with bones of men
and animals, the mouldering remains of those numerous
offerings once presented there. About the centre of the
terrace was the spot where the king's sacred house stood,
in which he resided during the season of strict <i>tabu</i>, and at
the north end, the place occupied by the houses of priests,
who, with the exception of the king, were the only persons
permitted to dwell within the sacred enclosures. Holes
were seen on the walls, all around this, as well as the lower
terraces, where wooden idols of varied size and shape formerly
stood, casting their hideous stare in every direction."<a name="FNanchor_98_1142" id="FNanchor_98_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_1142" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>From this somewhat indistinct description we gather
that the temple was a large oblong area enclosed by high
stone walls and open to the sky, and that at some place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
within the enclosure there rose a structure in a series of
terraces, of which the uppermost was paved with flat stones
and supported the king's house, while the houses of the
priests stood in another part of the sacred enclosure. If
this interpretation is correct, we may infer that the temple
resembled a Tahitian <i>morai</i>, which was a walled enclosure
enclosing a sort of stepped and truncated pyramid built of
stone.<a name="FNanchor_99_1143" id="FNanchor_99_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_1143" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The inference is confirmed by the language used by
Captain King in speaking of the temple which he describes,
for he calls it a <i>morai</i>,<a name="FNanchor_100_1144" id="FNanchor_100_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_1144" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and the same term is applied to the
sacred edifices in Hawaii by other voyagers.<a name="FNanchor_101_1145" id="FNanchor_101_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_1145" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Another ruined temple (<i>heiau</i>) seen by Ellis in Hawaii,
is described by him as built of immense blocks of lava,
and measuring a hundred and fifty feet long by seventy feet
wide. At the north end was a smaller enclosure, sixty feet
long and ten wide, partitioned off by a high wall, with but
one narrow entrance. The places where the idols formerly
stood were apparent, though the idols had been removed.
The spot where the altar had been erected could be distinctly
traced; it was a mound of earth, paved with smooth stones,
and surrounded by a firm curb of lava. The adjacent ground
was strewn with bones of the ancient offerings.<a name="FNanchor_102_1146" id="FNanchor_102_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_1146" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Another
temple (<i>heiau</i>), in good preservation, visited by Ellis, measured
no less than two hundred and seventy feet in one direction by
two hundred and ten in another. The walls were thick and
solid; on the top of them the stones were piled in a series
of small spires. The temple was said to have been built by
a queen of Hawaii about eleven generations back.<a name="FNanchor_103_1147" id="FNanchor_103_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_1147" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Once
more in one of the <i>puhonuas</i> or cities of refuge, which in
Hawaii afforded an inviolable sanctuary to fugitives, Ellis
saw another temple (<i>heiau</i>), which he describes as "a compact
pile of stones, laid up in a solid mass, 126 feet by 65, and
ten feet high. Many fragments of rock, or pieces of lava,
of two or more tons each, were seen in several parts of the
wall, raised at least six feet from the ground." Ellis was
told that the city of refuge, of which this temple formed
part, had been built for Keave, who reigned in Hawaii about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
two hundred and fifty years before the time when the
missionary was writing.<a name="FNanchor_104_1148" id="FNanchor_104_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_1148" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> From his descriptions we may
infer that some at least of the Hawaiian temples deserved
to rank among megalithic structures, and that the natives
had definite traditions of the kings or queens by whom the
temples had been built.</p>

<p>In the island of Oahu a temple (<i>heiau</i>) visited by the
missionary Stewart was forty yards long by twenty yards
broad. The walls, of dark stone, were perfectly regular and
well built, about six feet high, three feet wide at the level of
the ground, and two feet wide at the top. It was enclosed
only on three sides, the oblong area formed by the walls
being open on the west; from that side there was a descent
by three regular terraces or very broad steps.<a name="FNanchor_105_1149" id="FNanchor_105_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_1149" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This brief
account confirms the inference which I have drawn from the
more detailed description of Ellis, as to the terraced structure
of some Hawaiian temples.</p>

<p>In the mountains of Hawaii, at a height of about five
thousand feet above the sea, Commodore Wilkes saw the ruins
of an ancient temple of the god Kaili (Tairi), round about
which stood eight small pyramids built of compact blocks
of lava laid without cement. These pyramids were said
to have been erected at the command of Umi, an ancient
king, to commemorate his conquests. They seem to have
measured each some ten or twelve feet square. The temple
which they surrounded was about ninety-two feet long by
seventy-two feet wide; the outer walls were about seven
feet high and as many thick. Internally the edifice was
divided by partition walls three feet high. The building
was said to have been formerly covered with idols, of which
no traces remained at the time of Wilkes's visit.<a name="FNanchor_106_1150" id="FNanchor_106_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_1150" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Often, apparently, a Hawaiian temple consisted of little
more than a walled or palisaded enclosure containing a
number of rudely carved images and a place of sacrifice in
the form of a platform raised on poles. Such a temple is
described by the Russian navigator Lisiansky. The images
in it were grouped and arranged so as to form a sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
semicircle. The chief priest of the temple informed the
Russians "that the fifteen statues wrapped in cloth represented
the gods of war; the two to the right of the place of
sacrifice, the gods of spring; those on the opposite side, the
guardians of autumn; and that the altar was dedicated to
the god of joy, before which the islanders dance and sing on
festivals appointed by their religion." With regard to the
temples in general, Lisiansky observes that they "were by
no means calculated to excite in the mind of a stranger
religious veneration. They are suffered to remain in so
neglected and filthy a condition, that, were it not for the
statues, they might be taken rather for hog-sties than places
of worship."<a name="FNanchor_107_1151" id="FNanchor_107_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_1151" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The images of the gods were usually carved of wood.
When a new idol was to be made, a royal and priestly
procession went forth, with great ceremony, to the destined
tree, where the king himself, with a stone axe, struck the
first blow at the root. After the tree was felled, a man or
a hog was killed and buried on the spot where it had grown.<a name="FNanchor_108_1152" id="FNanchor_108_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_1152" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
Sometimes, apparently, the direction to carve an idol out
of a particular tree was given by a god in a dream. There
is a tradition that once when the woodmen were felling
such a tree with their stone axes, the chips flew out and
killed two of them; whereupon the other woodmen covered
their faces with masks, and cut down the tree with their
daggers.<a name="FNanchor_109_1153" id="FNanchor_109_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_1153" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Another famous idol was said to be made of
wood so poisonous, that if chips of it were steeped in water,
and anybody drank of the water, he would die in less than
twenty-four hours.<a name="FNanchor_110_1154" id="FNanchor_110_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_1154" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The Hawaiians seem to have made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
their idols hideous on purpose to inspire terror.<a name="FNanchor_111_1155" id="FNanchor_111_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_1155" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The
features of some of the images were violently distorted, their
mouths set with a double row of the fangs of dogs, their eyes
made of large pearl oysters with black nuts in the middle;
some had long pieces of carved wood, shaped like inverted
cones, rising from the top of their heads;<a name="FNanchor_112_1156" id="FNanchor_112_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_1156" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> some had
tongues of a monstrous size, others had no tongues at all;
some had mouths that reached from ear to ear; the heads
of some were a great deal larger than their bodies.<a name="FNanchor_113_1157" id="FNanchor_113_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_1157" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Some
of the idols were stones. In the island of Hawaii there
is a pebbly beach from which pebbles used to be carried
away to be deified or to represent deities. They were
generally taken in couples, a male and a female, and
having been wrapt up very carefully together in a piece of
native cloth, they were conveyed to a temple (<i>heiau</i>), where
ceremonies of consecration or deification were performed
over them.<a name="FNanchor_114_1158" id="FNanchor_114_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_1158" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The human sacrifice offered at the making of an idol
was intended to impart strength to the image.<a name="FNanchor_115_1159" id="FNanchor_115_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_1159" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> But human
sacrifices were offered on many other occasions, such as on
the approach of war, on the death of a chief, and so forth.
There is a tradition that Umi, a famous king of Hawaii,
once offered eighty men to his god as a thank-offering for
victory. The victims were generally prisoners of war, but
in default of captives any men who had broken taboos or
rendered themselves obnoxious to the chiefs were sacrificed.
It does not appear that they were slain in the presence of
the idol or within the temple, but either on the outside or
where they were first taken; in all cases an attempt seems
to have been made to preserve the body entire or as little
mangled as possible. Generally the victims were despatched
by a blow on the head with a club or stone; sometimes,
however, they were stabbed. Having been stripped naked,
the bodies were carried into the temple and laid in a row,
with their faces downwards, on the altar immediately before
the idol. The priest thereupon, in a kind of prayer, offered
them to the gods; and if hogs were sacrificed at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
time, they were afterwards piled on the human bodies and
left there to rot and putrefy together.<a name="FNanchor_116_1160" id="FNanchor_116_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_1160" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>When a new temple was about to be dedicated, some
of the people used to flee into the mountains to escape
being sacrificed. The last human sacrifices are said to have
been offered in 1807, when the queen of the islands was
seriously ill.<a name="FNanchor_117_1161" id="FNanchor_117_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_1161" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Whenever war was in contemplation, the
diviners used to sacrifice animals, generally hogs and fowls,
and to draw omens from the manner in which they expired,
from the appearance of their entrails, and from other signs.
Sometimes, when the animal was slain, they disembowelled
it, took out the spleen, and, holding it in their hands, offered
their prayers. But if the contemplated expedition was of
any importance or the danger was imminent, human sacrifices
were offered to ensure the co-operation of the war-gods in
the destruction of their enemies.<a name="FNanchor_118_1162" id="FNanchor_118_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_1162" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 8. <i>Festivals</i></h4>

<p>In every lunar month the people celebrated four festivals.
The festival of the new moon lasted three nights and two
days; the three others lasted two nights and one day.
These nights and days were taboo or sacred: men who took
part in the festivals might not speak to a woman under pain
of death, and all the people were forbidden to sail the sea,
to fish, to make bark-cloth, and to play games.<a name="FNanchor_119_1163" id="FNanchor_119_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_1163" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Besides
these monthly festivals there was one called Macahity, which
lasted for a whole month and seems to have celebrated the
end of the old year. It fell in November, and has been
compared by Lisiansky to our festival of Christmas. He
tells us that "it continues a whole month, during which the
people amuse themselves with dances, plays, and sham-fights
of every kind. The king must open this festival wherever
he is. On this occasion, his majesty dresses himself in his
richest cloak and helmet, and is paddled in a canoe along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
the shore, followed sometimes by many of his subjects. He
embarks early, and must finish his excursion at sun-rise.
The strongest and most expert of the warriors is chosen to
receive him on his landing. This warrior watches the
royal canoe along the beach; and as soon as the king lands,
and has thrown off his cloak, he darts his spear at him,
from a distance of about thirty paces, and the king must
either catch the spear in his hand, or suffer from it: there
is no jesting in the business. Having caught it, he carries
it under his arm, with the sharp end downwards, into the
temple or <i>heavoo</i>. On his entrance, the assembled multitude
begin their sham-fights, and immediately the air is obscured
by clouds of spears, made for the occasion with blunted
ends. Hamamea [the king, Kamehameha] has been
frequently advised to abolish this ridiculous ceremony,
in which he risks his life every year; but to no effect.
His answer always is, that he is as able to catch a spear,
as any one on the island is to throw it at him. During the
Macahity, all punishments are remitted throughout the
country; and no person can leave the place in which he
commences these holidays, let the affair requiring his
absence be ever so important."<a name="FNanchor_120_1164" id="FNanchor_120_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_1164" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The ceremony of throwing
a spear at the king during the festival of Macahity has been
described also by the Scotch sailor Archibald Campbell,
who may have witnessed it. He says: "The king remains
in the <i>morai</i> for the whole period; before entering it, a
singular ceremony takes place. He is obliged to stand
till three spears are darted at him: he must catch the first
with his hand, and with it ward off the other two. This is
not a mere formality. The spear is thrown with the utmost
force; and should the king lose his life, there is no help for
it."<a name="FNanchor_121_1165" id="FNanchor_121_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_1165" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> This curious rite may perhaps have been a relic of
an old custom which obliged the king to submit once a year
to the ordeal of battle, in order to prove his fitness for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
renewed tenure of office, death being the penalty of defeat
and the kingdom the reward of victory in the combat.<a name="FNanchor_122_1166" id="FNanchor_122_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_1166" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
During the continuance of the festival the priests were
employed in collecting the taxes, which were paid by
the chiefs in proportion to the extent of their territories;
these taxes consisted of mats, feathers, and the produce of
the country. The people celebrated the festival by dancing,
wrestling, and other amusements.<a name="FNanchor_123_1167" id="FNanchor_123_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_1167" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The victor in the boxing
matches and martial evolutions was crowned and treated as
king of the festival, which was held in honour of the god
Rono.<a name="FNanchor_124_1168" id="FNanchor_124_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_1168" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>No one might go to war during the New Year festival;
all the people had to repair to the temples (<i>morais</i>). Three
kinds of idols were worshipped at this season; the principal
of them, called Kekou-Aroha, was carried round the island
by a priest; everything that he could seize with his left
hand he had the right to appropriate, whether it was dogs,
pigs, vegetables, or what not; and any person on whom
he in like manner laid a hand was bound to assist him in
carrying or leading to the temple the tribute or booty he
had thus taken possession of.<a name="FNanchor_125_1169" id="FNanchor_125_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_1169" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Of the rigour with which the laws of taboo were enforced
during one of these festivals we may gather an idea from
a statement of the Russian navigator von Kotzebue. He
says: "As Kareimoku's guests, we were present at the
celebration of a <i>Tabu pori</i>, which lasted from the setting of
the sun to sunrise on the third day. It is already known
what degree of sanctity is imparted to him who joins in
this communion with the gods during the time. Should
he accidentally touch a woman, she must be instantly put
to death. Should he enter a woman's house, the flames
must immediately consume it."<a name="FNanchor_126_1170" id="FNanchor_126_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_1170" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<h4>&sect;9. <i>Death and Funeral Rites</i></h4>

<p>The Hawaiians explained life as usual by the hypothesis
of a soul (<i>uhane</i>), which animated the whole body, but had
its seat especially in the sockets of the eyes, and above all
in the lachrymal gland. During sleep the soul quits the
body, wanders away, and sees the places and things which
appear to it in dreams; usually it returns in time to resume
its functions in the body without endangering the health of
the sleeper. Occasionally, however, it happens that in its
rambles it loses its way through falling in with a ghost or
spectre, who frightens it; but even then it may be brought
back with the help of a familiar spirit despatched to seek
out and guide home the wanderer. When a man falls
sick, his soul begins to feel ill at ease in his body, and
if the sickness proves fatal, the soul quits him never to
return.<a name="FNanchor_127_1171" id="FNanchor_127_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_1171" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> According to another account, the Hawaiians held
that every man had two souls in his body, of which one
never left him in life, while the other went forth from time
to time in dreams or ecstasy, but only to return to its
corporeal tabernacle. Sometimes a diviner would warn a
man that he had seen his dream-soul roaming about, and
that perhaps it might never come back, because a certain
deity was angry with him. Upon that the terrified owner
of the soul would naturally engage the diviner to recover
his spiritual property by propitiating the angry deity with a
valuable offering.<a name="FNanchor_128_1172" id="FNanchor_128_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_1172" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Sickness was commonly explained by the presence in
the sufferer of an evil spirit, who must be exorcised if the
patient was to be restored to health. For this purpose
the services of a priest (<i>kahuna</i>) were engaged, who by the
recitation of a suitable incantation invited or compelled the
demon to declare through the mouth of the sick man why
he had entered into him, and on what terms he would
consent to take his departure. Sometimes, the demon was
induced to perch on the head or shoulders of one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
bystanders, and from that coign of vantage to answer the
interrogatory of the priest. But at other times he burrowed
so deep into the patient's body and held his tongue so
obstinately, that the priest had no alternative but to prick
the sick man's body with bamboo needles and to drop water
into his eyes in order to drive out the evil spirit.<a name="FNanchor_129_1173" id="FNanchor_129_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_1173" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>When all remedies had proved vain and death had
followed, the bodies of common people were buried in a
crouching position. The upper part of the body was raised;
the face was bent forwards to meet the knees; the hands
were put under the hams and passed up between the knees;
then head, hands, and knees were bound together with cinnet
or cord. Afterwards the corpse was wrapt up in a coarse
mat and interred on the first or second day after death.
But the corpses of chiefs and priests were not thus doubled
up; they were laid out straight, wrapt up in many folds
of native cloth, and buried in that posture. Priests were
generally committed to the earth within the precincts of the
temple in which they had officiated. A pile of stones or a
circle of high poles marked their grave. But it was only
the bodies of priests or of persons of some importance that
were thus interred. For ordinary people natural graves
were preferred, where suitable places could be found, such
as caves in the face of cliffs or large subterranean grottos.
Sometimes the inhabitants of a village deposited their dead
in one great cavern, but generally each family had a distinct
sepulchral cave. Their artificial graves were either simple
pits dug in the earth or large enclosures, which might be
surrounded with high stone walls so as to resemble the
ordinary temples (<i>heiaus</i>). Occasionally they buried their
dead in sequestered spots near their dwellings, but often in
their gardens, and sometimes in their houses. The graves
were not deep, and the bodies were usually placed in them
in a sitting posture.<a name="FNanchor_130_1174" id="FNanchor_130_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_1174" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> A rude method of embalming by
means of the flower of the sugar-cane was often practised,
whereby the entrails and brains were extracted and the body
desiccated.<a name="FNanchor_131_1175" id="FNanchor_131_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_1175" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> When the dead was interred in the dwelling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
the house was not uncommonly shut up and deserted, the
survivors seeking for themselves a new habitation.<a name="FNanchor_132_1176" id="FNanchor_132_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_1176" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The
custom no doubt sprang from a fear of the ghosts, which
were supposed to linger about their final resting-places and
to injure such as came within their reach; hence their
apparitions were much dreaded. For the same reason
burials were conducted in a private manner and by night.
If people were seen carrying a dead body past a house, the
inmates would abuse or even stone them for not taking it
some other way; for they imagined that the ghost would ply
to and fro between the grave and his old home along the
path by which his corpse had been carried.<a name="FNanchor_133_1177" id="FNanchor_133_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_1177" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Sometimes,
apparently, to prevent the ghost from straying, his grave
was enclosed by a sort of fence composed of long poles
stuck in the ground at intervals of three or four inches and
fastened together at the top. At all events Ellis saw a
priest's tomb thus enclosed, and he received this explanation
of the fence from some people; though others merely said
that it was a custom so to inter persons of consequence.<a name="FNanchor_134_1178" id="FNanchor_134_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_1178" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Nightmare was believed to be caused by a ghost attempting
to strangle the dreamer; under the influence of this belief
a strong man has been seen to run shrieking down the
street, tugging with both hands at his throat to tear the
incubus away, till he reached the door of a neighbour's
house and, bursting in, fell fainting on the floor. He
thought that the ghost of a chief, who had died the day
before, had a grip on his throat and was trying to throttle
him.<a name="FNanchor_135_1179" id="FNanchor_135_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_1179" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Sometimes, however, affection for the dead sufficed
to overcome the fear of the ghost, and the mouldering bones
were carried about as relics by relations and friends.<a name="FNanchor_136_1180" id="FNanchor_136_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_1180" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> When
the Scotch sailor Archibald Campbell was in the islands in
the early years of the nineteenth century, his patroness the
queen kept by her the bones of her father wrapt up in a
piece of cloth. Whenever she slept in her own house, the
bones were placed by her side; in her absence they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
set on a feather-bed which she had received from the
captain of a ship, and which she used only for this purpose.
On being asked by the Scotchman why she observed this
singular custom, she replied that it was because she loved
her father so dearly.<a name="FNanchor_137_1181" id="FNanchor_137_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_1181" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> More usually, however, the bones of
a beloved chief were carefully hidden to prevent his enemies
from finding them and making arrow-heads out of them,
with which to hunt rats, or otherwise profaning them. Hence
there was a proverb to the effect that the bones of bad
chiefs were not concealed. When the great King Kamehameha
died in 1819, his bones were hidden and disappeared
completely in some secret cave.<a name="FNanchor_138_1182" id="FNanchor_138_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_1182" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The death of a king or great chief in former days was
the occasion for the observance of some singular ceremonies
and customs. The grief, real or pretended, of the people
found expression in many extravagant forms. Men and
women knocked out some of their front teeth with stones;
but the custom seems to have been observed even more
extensively by men than by women. The kinsmen or
friends of the deceased chief set the example, and their
retainers were obliged to imitate them. Sometimes a man
broke out his own tooth with a stone, but more usually the
service was rendered him by another, who fixed one end of
a stick against the tooth and hammered the stick with a
stone till the tooth broke off. If the men deferred the
operation, the women would perform it on them in their
sleep. More than one tooth was seldom sacrificed at one
time; but as the mutilation was repeated at the decease of
every chief of rank or authority, few men of mature years
were to be seen with a whole set of teeth, and many lost all
their front teeth both in the upper and the lower jaw.
Another mutilation practised at such times was to cut one
or both ears, but it seems to have been comparatively rare.
Much commoner was the custom of burning circles or semi-circles
on the face or breast by means of strips of burning
bark. The mourners also polled their hair in various ways.
Sometimes they made bald a small round piece on the
crown of the head, like the tonsure of Catholic priests;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
sometimes they shaved or cropped close the whole head
except round the edge, where a short fringe was left to
hang down; sometimes they made their heads quite bald
on one side and allowed the hair to remain long on the
other; occasionally they cut out a patch in the shape of a
horse-shoe either at the back of the head or above the
forehead; sometimes they shore a number of curved furrows
from ear to ear or from the forehead to the neck. When a
chief who had lost a relative or friend had his own hair cut
after any particular pattern, his followers and dependants
usually cropped their hair in the same style. Not to clip
or shave the hair in mourning was regarded as disrespectful
to the dead, but the particular manner of cutting it was left
to the taste of the individual.<a name="FNanchor_139_1183" id="FNanchor_139_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_1183" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Some people in their frenzy
knocked out their eyes with clubs and stones and cut as
well as burned their flesh.<a name="FNanchor_140_1184" id="FNanchor_140_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_1184" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Another peculiar badge of
mourning, adopted principally by the chiefs, was a black
spot or line tattooed on the tongue. The painful operation
was performed by puncturing the tongue with sharp fish-bones
dipped in colouring matter.<a name="FNanchor_141_1185" id="FNanchor_141_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_1185" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> But though these
personal mutilations were popular and almost universal on
the decease of chiefs, they appear not to have been practised
by the common people among themselves. Thus a wife
did not knock out her teeth on the death of her husband,
and a son did not thus express his grief for the loss of his
parents, nor they for the death of a child.<a name="FNanchor_142_1186" id="FNanchor_142_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_1186" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Similar extravagances in the expression of grief were
commonly exhibited by mourners, as we have seen, in other
parts of Polynesia; but in Hawaii the rites observed at the
death of a king or high chief were in so far peculiar that
they assumed the character of a Saturnalia or orgy of
unbridled lust and crime. On this subject the Russian
navigator Lisiansky, who visited the islands while the
ancient system of superstition was still in full vogue, reports
as follows: "On the death of the king, a scene of horror
takes place that is hardly credible. Twelve men are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
sacrificed; and shortly after the whole island abandons
itself for a month to the utmost disorder and licentiousness.
During this period, both sexes go entirely naked, and men
cohabit with women without any distinction: the woman
who should dare to make resistance, would be considered as
violating the laws of the country. The same licentiousness
is observed on the death of a noble; but it does not extend
beyond the domains of the deceased, and is of a much
shorter duration, not continuing, as Mr. Young informed me,
more than a few days, though attempts are made by the
youth of the party to prolong the period. Those who are
put to death on the demise of the king, or any great
personage, are such as have offered themselves for the
purpose during the life of their master; and they are in
consequence considered and treated by him as his best
friends, since they have sworn to live and die with him.
When I reflect upon the horrid nature of this ceremony, I
hardly know how to credit its existence amongst a race of
men so mild and good as these islanders in general appear
to be; but Mr. Young, whose veracity I had no reason to
doubt, assured me of the fact."<a name="FNanchor_143_1187" id="FNanchor_143_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_1187" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>This John Young, who gave Lisiansky information as
to the customs and religion of the Hawaiians, was an
Englishman who had resided in the islands for many years
at the time of the Russian navigator's visit in 1804.
Originally a sailor, born at Liverpool, he had been compulsorily
detained by the natives when he landed from his
ship in Hawaii in March 1790. But from the first he
received the kindest treatment from the king, Kamehameha,
whose full confidence and high esteem he enjoyed and
deserved. The king gave him a fine estate and appointed
him to several responsible offices; in particular Young was
governor of Hawaii for no less than nine years during the
king's absence. He married a native woman of rank, by
whom he had six children. While he remained warmly
attached to his native country and rendered essential
services to English vessels touching at the islands, he remained
a voluntary exile for forty-five years in Hawaii, where he
died at the patriarchal age of ninety-two in December 1835.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
During this long period he enjoyed the favour of the kings,
chiefs, and people, and was highly respected and esteemed
for his intelligence and good offices by European voyagers
to the islands.<a name="FNanchor_144_1188" id="FNanchor_144_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_1188" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Thus he had the best opportunities for
acquainting himself with the customs and beliefs of the
natives, and it is much to be regretted that of the ample
store of knowledge which he thus acquired nothing remains
but a few scattered notices recorded by travellers to whom
he had verbally communicated them.</p>

<p>In 1809, some five years after Lisiansky's visit to Hawaii,
the Scotch sailor Archibald Campbell witnessed one of these
Saturnalia held on the occasion of the death of the king's
brother. He says: "The public mourning that took place
on this occasion was of so extraordinary a nature that had I
not been an eye-witness, I could not have given credit to it.
The natives cut out their hair, and went about completely
naked. Many of them, particularly the women, disfigured
themselves, by knocking out their front teeth, and branding
their faces with red-hot stones, and the small end of calabashes,
which they held burning to their faces till a circular
mark was produced; whilst, at the same time, a general, I
believe I may say an universal, public prostitution of the
women took place. The queens, and the widow of the
deceased, were alone exempted. When the captain of a
ship that lay in the harbour remonstrated with the king
upon these disgraceful scenes, he answered, that such was
the law, and he could not prevent them."<a name="FNanchor_145_1189" id="FNanchor_145_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_1189" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>To these enormities the French navigator L. de Freycinet
bore similar testimony a few years later. He says: "The
despair which is affected after the loss of royal personages
or great nobles presents also a remarkable resemblance to
what takes place under similar circumstances among the
inhabitants of the Marianne Islands. When we landed in
Owhyhi [Hawaii], signs of sorrow everywhere presented themselves
to our eyes and witnessed to the excesses that had
been committed at the recent death of Tamehameha. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
such a crisis anarchy displays all its horrors: the laws and
the rules of taboo are broken without shame: the prohibited
foods are devoured without scruple, chiefly by the women:
the rights of property are ignored; force becomes the supreme
law: the voice of chiefs is powerless: old enmities are avenged
by blood or pillage: in a word, incredible scenes of disorder,
of cruelty, and of lust are everywhere renewed under the
stimulus of impunity. Calm does not begin to reign again
until the heir is definitely invested with the royal power.
Such is the mode in which the common people, freed for the
moment from all restraint, express the grief which they are
supposed to feel at the death of their sovereign."<a name="FNanchor_146_1190" id="FNanchor_146_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_1190" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>The early missionaries to Hawaii also testified to the
disorders which prevailed on these occasions, though they
seem not to have witnessed them. From their accounts we
gather that at such times the rights of property were as little
respected as the chastity of women. "On such an occasion,"
says Stewart, "every restraint was cast off, and all were in
the habit of following the impulse of any and every wild
passion that might seize them. Rights of person or of
property were no longer regarded; and he who had the
greatest muscular powers committed whatever depredation he
chose, and injured any one he thought proper. Even the
chiefs lost their ordinary pre-eminence, and could exert no
influence of restraint on the excesses of their subjects. It
was the time of redressing private wrongs, by committing
violence on the property and person of an enemy; and
everything that any one possessed was liable to be taken
from him. Their grief was expressed by the most shocking
personal outrages, not only by tearing off their clothes
entirely, but by knocking out their eyes and teeth with
clubs and stones, and pulling out their hair, and by burning
and cutting their flesh; while drunkenness, riot, and every
species of debauchery continued to be indulged in for days
after the death of the deceased."<a name="FNanchor_147_1191" id="FNanchor_147_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_1191" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> To the same effect Ellis
writes that "as soon as the chief had expired, the whole
neighbourhood exhibited a scene of confusion, wickedness, and
cruelty, seldom witnessed even in the most barbarous society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
The people ran to and fro without their clothes, appearing
and acting more like demons than human beings; every
vice was practised, and almost every species of crime perpetrated.
Houses were burnt, property plundered, even murder
sometimes committed, and the gratification of every base and
savage feeling sought without restraint. Injuries or accidents,
long forgotten perhaps by the offending party, were
now revenged with unrelenting cruelty."<a name="FNanchor_148_1192" id="FNanchor_148_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_1192" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> According to
Jarves, the early historian of Hawaii, on these occasions no
women were exempt from violation except the widows of the
deceased.<a name="FNanchor_149_1193" id="FNanchor_149_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_1193" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Such outbursts of passion, released from all restraints of
custom or law, are not unknown elsewhere on the occasion
of a death. Among the Ba-ila of Northern Rhodesia it is
customary at funerals for the women to sing lewd songs.
"Under ordinary circumstances it would be reckoned taboo
for women to utter such things in the presence of men; but
at funerals all restraints are removed. People do as they like.
Grass may be plucked out of the thatched roofs; the fields
may be robbed of the growing corn; all passions are let
loose; and no complaint for damage, theft, or adultery can
be made. This last item used to be the case; nowadays
fines are claimed."<a name="FNanchor_150_1194" id="FNanchor_150_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_1194" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The number of human victims sacrificed at the death of
a chief varied with his rank. For a king of Hawaii the
general number would seem to have been ten or twelve.<a name="FNanchor_151_1195" id="FNanchor_151_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_1195" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
But when King Kamehameha died in 1819, the priest
declared somewhat differently the custom in regard to human
sacrifice on such an occasion. When the corpse had been
removed from the king's own dwelling to a consecrated house
for the performance of the proper rites, a sacred hog was
baked and offered to it by the priest; for the dead king was
now deemed to be a god. Then addressing the chiefs and
the new king, the priest spoke as follows: "I will now make
known to you the rules to be observed respecting persons to
be sacrificed on the burial of his body. If you obtain one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
man before the corpse is removed, one will be sufficient;
but after it leaves this house four will be required. If delayed
until we carry the corpse to the grave, there must be ten;
but after it is deposited in the grave, there must be fifteen.
To-morrow morning there will be a tabu, and if the sacrifice
be delayed until that time, forty men must die." However,
on this occasion, no human blood was shed, but three hundred
dogs were sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_152_1196" id="FNanchor_152_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_1196" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The victims who were killed at the
death of the king, princes, and distinguished chiefs, and were
buried with their remains, belonged to the lowest class of
society. In certain families the obligation of dying with
the different members of such or such a noble house was
hereditary, so that at the birth of a child it was known
at whose death he must be sacrificed. The victims knew
their destiny, and their lot seems to have had no terror for
them.<a name="FNanchor_153_1197" id="FNanchor_153_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_1197" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>At Honaunau, in the island of Hawaii, there was a sort
of mausoleum in which the bones of dead kings and princes
were deposited. For some reason it was spared in the
general destruction of pagan monuments which took place
in 1819, and it was still almost intact when the missionary
Ellis visited and described it a few years later. It was a
compact building, twenty-four feet long by sixteen feet wide,
built of the most durable timber, and thatched with leaves.
It stood on a bed of lava jutting out into the sea, and was
surrounded by a strong fence, leaving a paved area in front
and at the two ends. Several rudely carved male and
female images of wood were placed on the outside of the
enclosure, some on low pedestals under the shade of a tree,
others on high posts planted on the jutting rocks which
overhung the edge of the water. A number of effigies
stood on the fence at unequal distances all around; but
the principal assemblage of idols was at the south-east end
of the enclosed space, where twelve of them stood in a
semicircle on a crescent-shaped basement of stone raised
about two feet above the pavement. Some of them rested
on small pedestals, others on pillars eight or ten feet high.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
The principal idol, distinguished by the variety and superiority
of the carving on its body and especially on its head, stood
in the middle, the others on either side of it, "as if perpetual
guardians of 'the mighty dead' reposing in the house
adjoining."<a name="FNanchor_154_1198" id="FNanchor_154_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_1198" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>When a death had taken place, the house in which it
occurred, was deemed defiled, and continued in that state
until after the burial. But if the deceased was a chief, the
whole land was polluted, and the heirs sought a residence in
another part of the country, until the corpse was dissected
and the bones tied in a bundle; for when that was done
the season of defilement terminated. Hence on the death
of King Kamehameha, his son and successor, Liholiho, had
to retire for a time to another district.<a name="FNanchor_155_1199" id="FNanchor_155_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_1199" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 10. <i>Fate of the Soul after Death</i></h4>

<p>The Hawaiians in general believed that the human soul
exists after death, but their notions on the subject were,
as usual, vague, confused, and contradictory. Some said
that all the souls of the departed went to the Po, or place
of night, and were there annihilated or eaten by the gods.<a name="FNanchor_156_1200" id="FNanchor_156_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_1200" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
According to another account, the souls of the dead that
had no claim to divinity fluttered about their old homes
till the moment arrived when they became the food of
the gods. It is not certain, adds de Freycinet, that they
recognised the immortality of the soul in the case of
persons of the lowest class.<a name="FNanchor_157_1201" id="FNanchor_157_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_1201" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Others said that some
souls went to the regions of Akea (Wakea) and Miru
(Milu), two ancient kings of Hawaii. Of these two, Akea
was reported to have been the first king of the island.
When he died, he descended into the nether world and
there founded a kingdom. His successor on the throne
of Hawaii, by name Miru or Milu, also descended into
the underworld at death, and shared the government of
the infernal realm with his predecessor Akea. Their land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
is a place of darkness, their food, lizards and butterflies.
But there are streams of water of which they drink, and
wide-spreading trees under which they recline.<a name="FNanchor_158_1202" id="FNanchor_158_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_1202" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Milu is
described as the Hawaiian Pluto, the lord of the lower
world to whose dominions departed spirits go. His abode
was in the west, hence the ghosts of such as died on the
eastern shore of an island always had to cross to the western
shore before they could set out for their final place of rest
in the spirit land. Some said that Milu had his dwelling
under the ocean, and that he was the prince of wicked
spirits.<a name="FNanchor_159_1203" id="FNanchor_159_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_1203" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> However, according to some accounts, the two
ancient kings, Milu and Akea, ruled over separate regions
in the spirit land, which were tabooed to each other, so
that nobody could pass from the one to the other. Akea
or Wakea dwelt in the upper region, and there the souls
of chiefs dwelt with him; whereas Milu occupied the muddy
lower region, and there the souls of common folk abode
with him. In the upper region all was peaceful and orderly,
and there persons who had faithfully complied with the
precepts of religion in life were received after death. On
the other hand the lower region, ruled over by Milu, was
noisy and disorderly; evil spirits played their pranks there,
and the souls of the dead subsisted on lizards and butterflies.<a name="FNanchor_160_1204" id="FNanchor_160_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_1204" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
When persons recovered from a death-like swoon, it
was supposed that their souls had gone to the underworld
and been sent back to earth by Milu. The best account of
the spirit land was given by one who had spent eight days
in it, and on returning to life reported to his family what
he had seen. According to his observations, the spirit land
is flat and fruitful, it is tolerably well lighted, and everything
grows there spontaneously, so that, contrary to some reports,
the palace of Milu is a really delightful place. Milu himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
is not married to any one particular wife; but from time to
time he chooses for his consorts the most beautiful of the
female ghosts when they arrive in deadland, and the women
thus honoured are naturally taboo for the male ghosts.
All souls live there in exactly the same state in which
they quitted their bodies. The souls of those who died
young, especially of those who fell in battle, are hale and
strong; whereas the souls of those who perished of disease
are sickly and weak, and weak, too, are the souls of such
as died in old age.<a name="FNanchor_161_1205" id="FNanchor_161_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_1205" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>There were three places in the islands from which the
ghosts took their departure for the other world. One was
at the northern extremity of the island of Hawaii; one
was at the western end of Maui; and one was at the southern
point of Oahu.<a name="FNanchor_162_1206" id="FNanchor_162_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_1206" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> According to one account, the ghosts on
their passage to Milu's subterranean realm went westward in
the direction of the setting sun, and either leaped from a
rock into the sea or vanished into a hole in the ground.<a name="FNanchor_163_1207" id="FNanchor_163_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_1207" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>But before bidding a last farewell to earth, the soul of
the deceased was believed to linger for a time in the
neighbourhood of the grave or of the house. It had now
become an <i>akua</i> or divine spirit, but during its stay on earth
it was dreaded as an <i>akua-lapu</i> or "terrifying spirit," because
it appeared to the living as a spectre or ghost. In time,
however, it grew weaker and weaker and gradually disappeared
altogether, like the other spirits (<i>akuas</i>). By that
time it had found a guide to show it the way to Milu's realm,
from which there is no return. Sometimes, however, the
guardian god of a family would oppose the passage of a soul
to the other world, and send it back to life, so that the
seemingly dead man recovered.<a name="FNanchor_164_1208" id="FNanchor_164_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_1208" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> It is said to have been a
firmly established belief that the dead appeared to the living
and communicated with them in dreams.<a name="FNanchor_165_1209" id="FNanchor_165_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_1209" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The priests in
particular were favoured with such messages from the
other world.<a name="FNanchor_166_1210" id="FNanchor_166_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_1210" class="fnanchor">[166]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>A legend tells how a certain chief of Hawaii, sorrowing
for the death of his wife, applied to a priest, who furnished
him with a god called Kane-i-kou-alii (God of Chiefs), to
guide him to the nether world of Milu, whither his beloved
spouse had departed. Journeying together, the god and
the man came to the end of the world, where grew a tree,
which split open and allowed them to glide down into the
depths. There the god hid behind a rock and allowed the
chief to go on alone, but first he rubbed stinking oil over
the chief's body. On arriving at Milu's palace the chief
found the whole court full of spirits engaged in such noisy
and tumultuous sports, that he could steal in among them
unobserved, all the more because the nearest spirits mistook
him for a ghost newly arrived with the stench of his dead
body still on him, so that they turned away from him in
disgust and made uncomplimentary remarks on his unsavoury
condition. When they had played all sorts of games, the
chief suggested that, as a new form of sport, they should all
take out their eyes and throw them in a heap. The suggestion
was accepted, and every one hastened to comply
with it. But the chief took care to mark where the eyes of
Milu fell, and snatching them up he hid them in the coco-nut
beaker which he carried with him. As all the spirits
were now blind, it was easy for the chief to make his way
to the neighbouring realm of Akea or Wakea, which was
tabooed to the spirits that swarmed in Milu's kingdom
and might not be entered by them. However, after long
negotiations, Milu was allowed to recover his eyes, on
condition that the soul of the chief's wife should be sent
back to earth and reunited to her body, which was happily
accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_167_1211" id="FNanchor_167_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_1211" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>The Hawaiians were not without some notion of a
general resurrection of the dead. When the missionary
William Ellis was conversing with some of the natives on
that subject, they said that they had heard of it before from
a native priest named Kapihe, who had lived at their village
in the time of King Kamehameha. The priest told the
king that at his death he would see his ancestors, and that
hereafter all the kings, chiefs, and people of Hawaii would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
live again. When Ellis asked them how this would be
effected, and with what circumstances it would be attended,
whether they would live again in Hawaii or in Miru (Milu),
the Hades of the Sandwich Islands, they replied that there
were two gods, who conducted the departed spirits of their
chiefs to some place in the heavens, where the souls of
kings and chiefs sometimes dwelt, and that afterwards the
two divine conductors returned with the royal and princely
souls to earth, where they accompanied the movements and
watched over the destinies of their survivors. The name of
one of these gods was Kaonohiokala, which means the eyeball
of the sun; and the name of the other was Kuahairo.
Now Kapihe was priest to the latter god, and professed to
have received a revelation, in accordance with which he informed
King Kamehameha that, when the monarch should
depart this life, the god Kuahairo would carry his spirit to
the sky and afterwards accompany it back to earth again,
whereupon his body would be restored to life and youth; that
he would have his wives again and resume his government
in Hawaii; that at the same time the existing generation
would see and know their parents and ancestors, and that
all the people who had died would rise again from the dead.<a name="FNanchor_168_1212" id="FNanchor_168_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_1212" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
It is to be feared, however, that the priest was a deceiver; for
King Kamehameha has not yet come to life again, and up
to the present time the general resurrection has not taken
place in Hawaii.</p>

<p>That must conclude what I have to say about the belief
in immortality and the worship of the dead in Polynesia,
The notions which the Polynesians entertained on this
subject cannot but strike a civilised European as childish,
while the customs which they based on them must appear
to him in great part foolish, even where they were not
barbarous and cruel. How far such childish notions and
foolish customs tend to confirm or to refute the widespread,
almost universal, belief in the survival of the human soul
after death, is a question which I must leave my readers
to answer for themselves.</p>

He says (p. 106) that the temple was
"called by the natives <i>Heavoo</i>, not
<i>Morai</i>, as some navigators have said."
The word <i>Heavoo</i> is probably identical
with the word <i>heiau</i>, which other writers
give as the Hawaiian name for a temple.
As to the form of the temples see
also A. Campbell, <i>Voyage round the
World</i>, pp. 175 <i>sq.</i>: "Their Morais,
or places of worship, consist of one
large house or temple, with some
smaller ones round it, in which are
the images of their inferior gods. The
tabooed or consecrated precincts are
marked out by four square posts,
which stand thirty or forty yards from
the building. In the inside of the
principal house there is a screen or
curtain of white cloth, hung across one
end within which the image of Etooah
[<i>atua</i>, <i>akua</i>] is placed." Remy (<i>op. cit.</i>
p. xl) describes the Hawaiian temples
as "simple enclosures of stones, roofless,
where the religious ceremonies
were performed."</p></div>

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<h3>TABOO AMOUNG THE MAORIS</h3>


<p>The power which Maori chiefs possessed of imposing, or at all
events of enforcing, a taboo seems not to have been quite so absolute
as might perhaps be inferred from the statement in the text.<a name="FNanchor_1_1213" id="FNanchor_1_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1213" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We
are told that the power of the taboo mainly depended on the influence
of the person who imposed it. If it were put on by a great
chief, it would not be broken, but a powerful man often violated the
taboo of an inferior. A chief, for example, would frequently lay one
of these sacred interdicts on a road or a river, and then nobody
would dare to go by either, unless he felt himself strong enough to
set the chief's taboo at defiance. The duration of the taboo was
arbitrary, and depended on the will of the person who imposed it.
Similarly with the extent to which the prohibition applied: sometimes
it was limited to a particular object, sometimes it embraced
many: sometimes it was laid on a single spot, at other times it
covered a whole district.<a name="FNanchor_2_1214" id="FNanchor_2_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1214" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>To render a place taboo a chief had only to tie one of his old
garments to a pole and stick it up on the spot which he proposed
to make sacred, while at the same time he declared that the prohibited
area was part of his own body, such as his backbone, or
that it bore the name of one of his ancestors. In the latter case
all the persons descended from that particular ancestor were in
duty bound to rally to the defence of the chief's taboo, and the
more distant the ancestor, and the more numerous his descendants,
the greater the number of the champions thus pledged to the
support of the family honour. Hence the longer a man's pedigree,
the better chance he stood of maintaining his taboo against all
comers, for the larger was the troop of adherents whom he enlisted
in its defence. Thus chiefs, with family trees which reached backward
to the gods, were in a far better position to make good
their arbitrary interdicts than mere ordinary mortals, who hardly
remembered their grandfathers. In this as in other respects the
taboo was essentially an aristocratic institution.<a name="FNanchor_3_1215" id="FNanchor_3_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1215" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edward Clodd</span> in the <i>DAILY CHRONICLE</i>.&mdash;"'If a man die, shall
he live again?' is a question asked chiliads before Job put it, and the generations
of mankind repeat it. In this profoundly interesting volume, Professor Frazer,
out of the treasury of his knowledge, and with consummate art of attractive
presentment, gives the answers devised by the Lower Races."</p>

<p><i>FOLK-LORE</i>.&mdash;"It displays all the best qualities, both in respect of style
and matter, that characterise Dr. Frazer's former works."</p>

<p><i>NEW STATESMAN</i>.&mdash;"Dr. Frazer does not profess to explain the
ultimate source of religion, but only to attempt to follow the steps of its growth
among the races of men. It is his aim to set before us a continent of facts known,
or partly known, to the anthropologists, not a solution of the mystery of the
Universe. That aim he has achieved with masterly success and lucidity."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">A. E. Crawley</span> in <i>NATURE</i>.&mdash;"The analysis of belief and practice
among the aborigines of Australia, the Torres Straits, New Guinea, and
Melanesia, which occupies nearly 400 pages of this volume, is a masterly
performance."</p>

<p><i>GUARDIAN</i>.&mdash;"The bare facts which Dr. Frazer sets before us are of an
absorbing interest.... The Biblical student may gain much from the perusal of
Dr. Frazer's work."</p>

<p><i>OBSERVER</i>.&mdash;"The importance of the work which Dr. Frazer has undertaken
cannot be overrated. His study of religion is a contribution to human
knowledge of such quality that the country to which he belongs may well be
proud of him.... Dr. Frazer has arranged the mass of detail from which he
has had to draw with a skill and judgment which in the work of another man
would be surprising; and he tells each story with the point and clarity of an
artist, so that, apart from the book's high mission, it could be read as a storehouse
of good tales. His comments, moreover, are always brief and decisive."</p>

</p></div>


<p><i>TIMES</i>.&mdash;"The book is a great book, in just the sense in which the work
of Darwin, Zola, or Balzac is great. It has explored and mapped out a new
world. But it combines artistry with science. Not only does it describe the
greater part of the magical and religious beliefs and practices of the lower races
and peasant peoples of the world, with a scientific precision and completeness
superior to those of the encyclop&aelig;dic biologist; it also narrates, with greater
truth and vividness than has ever been essayed, the tragi-comedy of human
superstition."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">A. E. Crawley</span> in <i>NATURE</i>.&mdash;"This new edition is something more
than a mere enlargement. It is a new book, or a series of books; yet it is the
same 'Golden Bough.' The reader will find it full of good things, new and old.
He will also realise that 'The Golden Bough' is a great book, one of the
great books of our time."</p>


<h4>THE GOLDEN BOUGH: <span class="smcap">A Study in Magic and Religion.</span><br />
Abridged Edition. With Frontispiece. 8vo. 18s. net.</h4>

<p>This abridgment has been prepared in response to numerous
requests that the work should be issued in a more compendious
form. While the book has been greatly reduced in bulk, by omission
of all the notes and occasional condensation in the text, all the
main principles of the complete work are retained, together with a
sufficient amount of evidence to illustrate them clearly. Nothing
has been added, and no change has been made in the author's views.
It is hoped that in this abridged form the book may prove welcome
to students and general readers who cannot afford to buy and read
the complete edition.</p>




<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[3]</a></span></p>


<h4>FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. Studies
in Comparative Religion, Legend, and Law.<br />
Three vols. 8vo. 37s. 6d. net.</h4>

<p><i>TIMES</i>.&mdash;"The idea of illustrating the Old Testament by analogies drawn
from the myths, customs, and superstitions of various primitive peoples is not, of
course, a new one ... but no one has hitherto published anything to be
compared with the vast and varied store of information which Sir James Frazer
now places before us.... His book is a mine of instructive facts for which all
future students of the subject will be grateful."</p>

<p><i>NATURE</i>.&mdash;"These three volumes should be the household companion of
every religious teacher, nay, of every one who cares or dares to see what that
latest daughter of science, folk-lore, has to say about the cherished beliefs from
the Old Testament, absorbed in infancy, and rarely visualised differently in
later life."</p>

<p><i>SPECTATOR</i>.&mdash;"We may say at once that Sir James Frazer's new work is
profoundly interesting, and that it throws a flood of light on many familiar
episodes and references."</p>


<h4>TOTEMISM AND EXOGAMY. A Treatise on Certain
Early Forms of Superstition and Society. With Maps.<br />
Four vols. 8vo. 50s. net.</h4>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">A. E. Crawley</span> in <i>NATURE</i>.&mdash;"That portion of the book which is
concerned with totemism (if we may express our own belief at the risk of offending
Prof. Frazer's characteristic modesty) is actually 'The Complete History of
Totemism, its Practice and its Theory, its Origin and its End.'... Nearly two
thousand pages are occupied with an ethnographical survey of totemism, an invaluable
compilation. The maps, including that of the distribution of totemic
peoples, are a new and useful feature."</p>


<h4>THE MAGICAL ORIGIN OF KINGS. (Formerly
published as "Lectures on the Early History of the Kingship.")<br />
8vo. 10s. 6d. net.</h4>

<p><i>ATHEN&AElig;UM</i>.&mdash;"It is the effect of a good book not only to teach, but also
to stimulate and to suggest, and we think this the best and highest quality, and
one that will recommend these lectures to all intelligent readers, as well as to the
learned."</p>


<h4>PSYCHE'S TASK. A Discourse concerning the Influence
of Superstition on the Growth of Institutions.<br />
Second Edition, revised and enlarged. To which is added
"The Scope of Social Anthropology."<br />
8vo. 6s. 6d. net.</h4>

<p><i>OUTLOOK</i>.&mdash;"Whether we disagree or agree with Dr. Frazer's general
conclusions, he has provided us with a veritable storehouse of correlated facts, for
which, and for the learning that has gone to their collection, and for the
intellectual brilliance that has gone to their arrangement, we can never be
sufficiently grateful."</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[4]</a></span></p>
<h4>PAUSANIAS'S DESCRIPTION OF GREECE. Translated
with a Commentary, Illustrations, and Maps.<br />
Second Edition. Six vols. 8vo. 126s. net.</h4>

<p><i>ATHEN&AElig;UM</i>.&mdash;"All these writings in many languages Mr. Eraser has
read and digested with extraordinary care, so that his book will be for years the
book of reference on such matters, not only in England, but in France and
Germany. It is a perfect thesaurus of Greek topography, arch&aelig;ology, and art."</p>


<h4>STUDIES IN GREEK SCENERY, LEGEND AND
HISTORY. Selected from Sir <span class="smcap">J. G. Frazer's</span> Commentary
on Pausanias.<br />
Globe 8vo. 5s. net.</h4>

<p><i>GUARDIAN</i>.&mdash;"Here we have material which every one who has visited
Greece, or purposes to visit it, most certainly should read and enjoy.... We
cannot imagine a more excellent book for the educated visitor to Greece."</p>


<h4>SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY, AND OTHER
LITERARY PIECES.<br />
Crown 8vo. 8s. 6d. net.</h4>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH</i>.&mdash;"These various studies, biographical, fantastic,
and romantic, are the fine flower of scholarship and taste, touched continually by
the golden light of imagination, and full of that interpretative sympathy which is
half-sister to creation."</p>

<h4>LETTERS OF WILLIAM COWPER. Chosen and
Edited, with a Memoir and a few Notes, by Sir <span class="smcap">J. G.
Frazer.</span><br />
Two vols. Globe 8vo. l0s. net.</h4>

<p style='text-align:right'>
[<i>Eversley Series.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clement Shorter</span> in the <i>DAILY CHRONICLE</i>.&mdash;"The introductory
Memoir, of some eighty pages in length, is a valuable addition to the
many appraisements of Cowper that these later years have seen.... Dr. Frazer
has given us two volumes that are an unqualified joy."</p>


<h4>ESSAYS OF JOSEPH ADDISON. Chosen and Edited,
with a Preface and a few Notes, by Sir <span class="smcap">J. G. Frazer.</span><br />
Two vols. Globe 8vo. 10s. net.</h4>

<p style='text-align:right'>
[<i>Eversley Series.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>NATION</i>.&mdash;"Sir James Frazer, who writes a Preface, quite in the Addison
manner, has done his work of selection as only a scholar of his breadth and
distinction could achieve."</p>
